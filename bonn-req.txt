Reimbursement Request:

Airfare: $730.65

I booked a ticket from Columbia to Frankfurt, departing July 9, and returning home from Helsinki July 29. The airfare was $1.461.30, of which I'm requesting only half because the period after July 18 was vacation.

I'm also attaching an Expedia printout which shows that roundtrips from Columbia to Frankfurt were not available for less than $1,461.30.

Cab to Columbia Airport, July 9: $29.00.

Ground transportation in Germany, to/from Frankfurt Airport/Bonn: 
Base ticket: EUR 48.40 = $67.05 (see attached bank statement)

Addition: EUR 24.00 = $32.68 (on July 10, per oanda.com)
Necessary because my flight was delayed and I did not arrive in time for the train I booked.

Hotel: President Hotel, Bonn, July 10-19, $770.94.

Per Diem: Bonn, July 11-18: $101 (per US State) x 8 = $808.00

Total request:
730.65 + 29 + 67.05 + 32.68 + 770.94 + 808.00 = $2436.32
