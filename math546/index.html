<b>Instructor:</b> Frank Thorne, thorne [at] math [dot] sc [dot] edu

<FONT SIZE =+2> <B> Course objectives/learning outcomes: </B> </Font> </p>
Successful students will master the foundations of abstract group theory, be able to 
describe typical examples of groups and explain their properties, and be able to understand and provide
descriptions of groups given in both abstract or visual formats.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, as with any 500-level pure math class, students will also:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Thoroughly understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to precisely state definitions and theorems and understand how they are applied.
<p>
<li>Practice writing <b>proofs.</b> It is expected that the student will have some, but not a lot, of experience writing proofs.
The student will gain more practice.
<p>
<li>Practice good <b>mathematical writing</b>. In mathematics, as indeed in everything else, it is important not only to be correct but to explain yourself clearly and as simply as possible.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning.</b> You should expect 5-8 hours of homework a week in this class;
in my experience there is no other way to learn the material. Your consistent effort will certainly lead to improved understanding,
and it will almost certainly lead to you earning high grades.
<P>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
Nathan Carter, <i>Visual Group Theoryy</i>, MAA Press. You can buy it 
<a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/clrm-32/">from the publisher</a>, from the campus bookstore, or from your
favorite online bookseller. 
<p>
Occasionally, I am likely to present some material not from the text. For this, I will write up supplementary
notes and make them freely available to you.


<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Lectures </b> </font>: MWF 12:00-12:50, LeConte 315.
<p>
The class will mostly be in a lecture format, but will also include some classroom discussion and in-class group work.

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Microsoft Teams </b> </font>:
<p>
We will use <b>Microsoft Teams</b> for announcements, discussion, and (if I get sick) livestreaming. 
<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Midterm Exams</b> </font>:
There will be two two-hour take-home, closed-book, pledged midterms. After they are handed out you will have at least a 72-hour period in which to finish them. Dates will be announced later in the term.
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Final Exam</b> </font>: The final will be three hours, and also take-home, closed-book, and pledged. (???) 
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:
<p>
The homework is intended to take 5-8 hours a week. That is a lot. Please
count on making a consistent effort to do well in this class! Starting the night before is a bad idea.
<p>
If homework takes you more than 10 hours on any given week, then that is more than I intended;
please let me know.
<p>
There <b>might</b> be a <b>bonus</b> problem on some of the homeworks (not guaranteed!), good for extra credit.
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
<b>Please note</b>. You will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. Indeed, a major
focus of Math 580 is the ability to communicate mathematical ideas clearly.
<b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
In particular, please write in <b>complete English sentences</b> and draw <b>clear diagrams</b> where appropriate.

Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.
<p>
<b>Grading scale</b>: You are guaranteed at least the following: A = 88+, B+ = 83+, B = 75+, C+ = 70+, C = 60+, D = 50+. 
<p>
<b>Please note that my grading scale is more generous than the usual 10-point scale.</b> However,
I am a (slightly) stricter grader than most.
This is intended
to balance out.

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Contacting me </b> </font>:

<b>Please contact me if you have any questions about the course, about my expectations, about my lectures,
about the homeworks, about the reading, or about anything else</b>. The syllabus is demanding and it is my
job to help you succeed.

The best ways to get help are to come to office hours (no appointment necessary) or to e-mail me (during the week, I will
almost always reply within 24 hours). If neither of these work for you then please e-mail me to set up an
appointment.

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>
In case of illness or emergency, please let me know immediately; alternative arrangements will be made. 
Beyond this, late homework will be accepted <b>once per student</b>, up to one week late, with no excuse needed.
<p>
<b>Academic honesty</b> and <b>attendance</b> are expected of all students.
<P>

<b>Calculators</b> will not be needed or allowed. 

</ul>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Accommodations </b> </font>:

If you require special accommodations, please talk to the 
<a href="https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/">Student Disability
Resource Center</a> as soon as possible. If is your responsibility to advise me of any needed accomodations
a week in advance.
<p>
<b>Important. If you have difficulty seeing the board or hearing the lectures, or 
a related problem, let me know ASAP,</b> and I will do something
about it. Similarly if anyone is engaged in harassing or bullying behavior.
<p>
It is very
important to me that everyone feel comfortable in class and have the opportunity to succeed.
