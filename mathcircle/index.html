The <b>Columbia Math Circle</b> is an enrichment activity for high school students in the Columbia, SC Area.

<p>

<h2>What Is A Math Circle?</h2>
<p>
Math Circles are communities focused on the enjoyment of mathematical problem solving. Meetings are lively, interactive, challenging, and fun.
<p>
Much of the discussion will be <b>open ended</b>: often the questions will be vague, and it will be up to you to figure out how to make them precise --
or to think of your own questions to ask and answer!
<p>
Ours is one of many <a href="https://mathcircles.org/about/">Math Circles</a> throughout the nation!

<p>
<hr>
<h2>What Isn't A Math Circle?</h2>
<p>
Each Math Circle will focus on a single advanced topic -- often not something covered in high school. If you're looking for extra help for your classes,
or SAT tutoring, then this isn't really the place.
<p>
Also the Math Circle is not competition-focused. For many, competitions are great fun! And preparing for them can be a great way to learn a lot of math.
<p>

<h2>First Meeting</h2>
The first meeting will be <b>Saturday, March 2 from 10:00-11:30 am</b> at the <b>Hammond School</b> (see below for directions).

<p>
The topic will be <b>Probability and The Price Is Right</b>. We will look at some clips from The Price Is Right, and try to figure
out the contestants' probabilities of winning. Some of these questions are easy, and some are <i>very</i> difficult.
<p>
Future meetings will cover the gamut of math -- algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and much else!
