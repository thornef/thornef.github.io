<P>

<b>Thanks for visiting the number theory group at the University of South Carolina!</b>
<p>
The math department is located at 1523 Greene Street, downtown. If you're driving there are parking meters and garages
all around campus, or borrow Frank's neighborhood parking pass.
<p>
If you're flying, the most convenient option is likely to be
<a href="http://www.columbiaairport.com/">Columbia Metropolitan Airport</a>. They have direct service to all
the nearby hub airports for various airlines, and from there you can get anywhere. From the airport,
it's about a $20 taxi ride to campus or to nearby hotels. (Please get a receipt so we can reimburse you!) 
Depending on your schedule, one of us will
very possibly be able to pick you up.
<p>
An alternative is flying into Charlotte or Atlanta and either taking the 
<a href="http://www.columbiacharlotteshuttle.com/">Charlotte shuttle</a> or renting a car. This may be especially
convenient if you 
want to speak in the number theory seminars at other local places such as Clemson, the University of Georgia,
Emory, and/or Georgia Tech, among others. I encourage you to contact them -- they are generally very receptive
to visitors offering to come and give talks.
<p>
In any case, please book your own airline tickets and bring receipts for reimbursement.
<p>
We often put up visitors in the <a href="http://www.clarionhotelcolumbia.com/">Clarion Hotel</a> -- a nice hotel
within easy walking distance of campus and also tourist attractions such as the State House, etc. The hotel is a historic
building, it is where General Sherman quartered his troops at the end of the Civil War. If you prefer to stay elsewhere,
please let us know.
<p> 
We always treat visitors out to dinner, we have excellent brewpubs, burritos, Thai food, Italian, traditional
Southern cuisine -- and much else besides.
