\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item
Thomas, 3.8: 11-18, 41-44, 69-74 (even required, odd additional).

\item
Sketch graphs of the six inverse trigonometric functions
$\sin^{-1}(x)$, $\cos^{-1}(x)$, $\tan^{-1}(x)$, $\cot^{-1}(x)$,
$\sec^{-1}(x)$, and $\csc^{-1}(x)$. State their domains and ranges,
and compute their derviatives.

\item
Thomas, 3.9: 1-8, 21-28 (Even required, odd additional).

\item
Thomas, 3.10: 17-40 (Even required, odd additional). Remember that 
you are {\bf required to draw and label a suitable picture} when appropriate
to the problem. 

\item
A searchlight $L$ is 200 feet from a prison wall. It rotates at a constant
rate of one revolution per 6 minutes. 

An escaped felon is running along the wall trying to keep just ahead of the beam
of light. At the moment when the searchlight angle is 45 degrees, how fast does
the prisoner have to run?
