Please work without books, notes, calculators, or any assistance from others. If you have
any questions, feel free to ask me. Please do your work on separate paper; you should staple this sheet to your work (put this on top)
and turn in everything together. 

The first four questions are 15 points and the last two are 20 each.

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ if $y = \frac{x}{4 - \tan x}$.

\item
Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ if $\sin(xy) = x^2 - \ln(y)$.

\item
If a ball is given a push so that it has an initial velocity of 5 $m/s$ down a certain
inclined plane, then the distance it has rolled after $t$ seconds is $s = 5t + 3t^2$.

(a) Find the velocity after 2 s.

(b) How long does it take for the velocity to reach 35 m/s?

\item
A plane flying horizontally at an altitude of 1 mi and a speed of 500 mi/h passes directly over a radar
station. Find the rate at which the distance from the plane to the station is increasing when it is 2 mi away from
the station.

\item
Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of $y = e^x - x$ on $[-1, 1]$.
\item
Graph the function $y = \frac{x}{2} - \sin(x)$ for $0 < x < 2 \pi$. Indicate where your graph is increasing or decreasing,
and where it is concave up and down. Indicate all the critical points and points of inflection.

\end{enumerate}
