<p>
<b>Welcome to Math 141!</b> Calculus is a beautiful, important, challenging, and fascinating subject.
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Instructional Staff </b> </font>:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Instructor:</b> Frank Thorne, thorne [at] math.sc.edu.
<br>
Available via Zoom: 844 730 1415 (password to be shared privately).
<br>

<br>
In-person Office Hours: Thursdays 9:30-10:30. 
<p>
<b>In person office hours</b> will be held outdoors, in front of LeConte on the west side of this building, near
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/thornef/tree.jpg">this tree</a>. <b>Please wear a mask, practice social distancing, and don't come
if you feel sick.</b>
If you just want to say hi or ask a quick question, no appointment is necessary. If you have a more detailed question,
ask in advance and I will try to arrange for a
a whiteboard.
<p>
In-person office hours will be moved to Zoom, in case of high Covid numbers or inclement weather.
<p>
<b>Zoom office hours</b> don't require an appointment. I am also available via Blackboard or Skype (just ask).

<p> 
<li><b>Teaching Assistant:</b> 
<br>
Matthew Booth, LeConte 107, mdbooth [at] math.sc.edu 
<br>
The TA will hold discussion/lab sections and
office hours and grade the homeworks. His job is to help you get through the course.
<br>
<p>
Office Hours: TBA.
<p>
<li><b>Supplemental Instructor:</b> Felicia McGill, fmcgill [at] email.sc.edu.
<br>
The <i>supplemental instructor</i> is an undergraduate who has done very well in Math 141 in the past.
She will attend all the lectures and is here to help.
<br>
In place of office hours she holds <b>SI sessions</b>; these will be held Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays,
from 5:00-5:50, via Blackboard.
</ul>
<p>
<p>

<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Meeting schedule </b> </font>:
<ul>
<li><b>Lectures:</b> MW, 2:20-3:35, online.
<p>
The <b>first lecture</b> will be held via <b>Blackboard Collaborate Ultra</b>. (In Blackboard, you can find this under "Course Tools".)
Please show up 10-15 minutes early for the first lecture so that we can make sure the technology is working.
<p>
We will probably stick with BBCU for the entire term, but we might switch technologies in case of technical difficulties.
<p>

<li><b>Recitation:</b> Depends on your section (contact your TA Matthew Booth)
</ul>

<FONT SIZE =+1> <B> Learning outcomes: </B> </Font>

<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul>
<li>Have ample opportunities to practice and use <b>algebra and trigonometry</b>, further increasing their skills in these areas. <b>Algebra
is an absolute prerequisite for calculus</b>, but at the same time the course will be directed towards students whose algebra skills may
be <b>slightly</b> rusty and in need of practice.
<li>Understand <b>quantitative data</b> and its presentation. In calculus, this usually takes the shape of a 
<b>function</b>. Functions will be presented in terms of equations, or in terms of graphs,
or in English text, and students will be required to <b>seamlessly translate</b> between these.
<li>Develop the ability to explain their work clearly. As with the previous bullet point, this 
will involve a combination of equations, graphs, and English text. <b>Students are expected to learn to write well.</b>
<li>Understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to give <b>precise definitions</b>
as well as <b>informal explanations</b> and will be able to <b>explain the correspondence.</b>
<li>Tackle problems that require more than one step to solve, or whose solution is not obvious. Typically this means that you <b>try
something</b>, and <b>if it doesn't work you try something else.</b>
</ul>
This could describe any math class. Typically, all of this is best learned in some <i>specific</i> context. Therefore,
successful students will also:
<ul>
<li>
Master concepts and problems involving limits, derivatives, integrals, and applications of all of the above.
</ul>
During 2020, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is on everyone's mind. This fall's class has a special learning outcome:
<ul>
<li>
Use concepts from calculus to interpret Covid-19 data, and to make tentative predictions about the progression of the
pandemic.
</ul>
<p>
This material will be optional; students may opt out from the Covid-19 material if they prefer.

<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
Thomas, <i> Calculus, Early Transcendentals, </i> 13th edition. 
The book is available from the campus bookstore; although the price is high, this price represents a substantial
discount which our department negotiated with the publisher. The book is bundled with access to MyMathLab, which
will also be used for 141. The same book will also be (presumably) used
for 142 and 241.
<p>
This is the same as the book used last year. Also, although the bookstore's books have
a special cover, my understanding is that the book is mostly identical to "non-custom editions"
available elsewhere, <b>provided that you get the 13th Edition</b>. (One difference: one chapter
has been removed, which is not used in 141, 142, or 241.)
You are also welcome to obtain the book elsewhere if you can find it -- but be sure that you are getting MyMathLab access.

<p>
I also highly recommend
<a href="http://djm.cc/library/Calculus_Made_Easy_Thompson.pdf">
Calculus Made Easy</a> by Silvanus Thompson.
If nothing else, read the epilogue on p. 283.

<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:

Homework will be due approximately weekly, via the <b>Pearson MyMathLab software</b>. 
Please follow <a href="mylab-instructions.pdf">these instructions</a> to set up your account and join the course.
This requires a Pearson access code; this should have been bundled if you bought your book new at the bookstore.
<p>
<b>The homeworks are long.</b> Do not start the night before. <b>They are also very important.</b>
<p>
In general it is recommended that you <b>write out solutions in longhand</b> before typing them into the computer,
as if you were taking a quiz or exam. This will help you prepare for the quizzes and exams!
<p>
Later in the semester, if the recitation section is still meeting physically, we might have a couple of 
<b>Maple Labs</b>. (This is doubtful at this point, but possible.)
For students participating remotely, either these will be made optional or alternative
assignments will be made.
Your TA will help you with these, and they will be counted together with the homework.
<p>
Accompanying each homework is a set of <b>practice problems</b>.
<b>All problems which will appear on any quiz, assessment, or exam will be taken from these practice problems.</b>
So you know exactly what to study. The online homeworks will correspond to a subset of these practice problems.

<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Quizzes </b> </font>:
Quizzes will be given in your discussion section with some regularity. Details will be announced by your TA. <b>To get full credit you must 
answer clearly, show your work, draw pictures where appropriate, and put equals signs where they belong.</b>
If we can't understand how you arrived at your answer, then you will receive little or no credit.

<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Assessments </b> </font>:
You will have <b>six short (30 minute) midterm assessments</b>. Think of them as somewhere between a quiz and an exam.
They will cover the following topics:
<ul>
<li><b>Assessment 1:</b> Precalculus (Chapter 1)
<li><b>Assessment 2:</b> Limits, continuity, and the definition of a derivative. (Ch. 2, 3.1, 3.2)
<li><b>Assessment 3:</b> Differentiation rules. (3.3-3.6; revised)
<li><b>Assessment 4:</b> Differentiation rules; related rates; maxima and minima. (3.7-3.10, 4.1)
<li><b>Assessment 5:</b> Optimization and L'Hopital; introduction to the integral. (4.5-5.4 -- tentative)
<li><b>Assessment 6:</b> First steps in integration (parts; areas; volumes) (5.5-6.3 -- tentative)
</ul>
These will be held in class, on dates that will be announced at least a week in advance.
As with quizzes, <b>to get full credit you must 
answer clearly, show your work, draw pictures where appropriate, and put equals signs where they belong.</b>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Final exam </b> </font>:
<b>The final exam won't be graded separately.</b> Instead, it will be divided
into six parts, corresponding to the midterm assessments. For each section, if you improve then your
previous grade will be replaced; otherwise, your midterm grade will be allowed to stand.

<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Gateways </b> </font>:
Math 141 also includes <b>gateway exams</b>, which are the same for all sections of Math 141. These help to ensure
a set of common standards, and assure you are prepared for future material.

There are two gateway exams:
<ul>
<li><b>Precalculus</b>, 8/20-30; 8/31-9/6; 9/7-9/13.
<li><b>Differentiation rules</b>, 10/12-10/18; 10/19-10/25; 10/26-11/1.
</ul>
The exams will be taken using the <b>WebWork</b> software, which will be explained further by your TA. These exams are computerized,
and "showing your work" isn't necessary.
<p>
Grading is on an all-or-nothing basis. <b>You have three attempts</b> for each exam, during the periods specified above. 
There are also <b>practice exams</b> available which don't count against your three attempts.

Finally, there is a <b>WebWork orientation</b> which is available immediately. 
<p>

<br>
<font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
On all handwritten work, you will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
The grade cutoffs are: A for 90%, B+ for 86%, B for 80%, C+ for 75%, C for 65%, and D for 50%.

<p>
In addition, there are <b>three ways to earn extra credit</b>:

<ul>

<li>
Do a project <b>analyzing some aspect of the Covid-19 data.</b> Alternatively, you may analyze similar data from the past -- for example,
explain how the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak was nipped in the bud. 
<p>
A good project will earn extra credit equivalent to at least one homework assignment. Outstanding work may earn more. 
The project is due with the final exam; <b>more details will be explained later.</b>

<li><b>Participate actively in the Piazza discussions</b>, by asking and answering questions. Continuous and active participation
will earn extra credit equivalent to one homework assignment. Exceptional participation may earn more.

<p>

<li>You will be given a final <b>extra credit assignment</b>, consisting of four practice final exams in the same format
as the actual final. This assignment will be worth one homework assignment.
</ul>

<P>
<hr>
<font size=+1> <b> Class discussion forum </b> </font>:

The class will use <b>Piazza</b> as an online discussion forum. <b>You are strongly encouraged to post questions
about the course there.</b> All of the instructional staff will check Piazza frequently and answer there. We will also
add our own additional thoughts, clarifications, and suggestions.
<p>
Students are also encouraged to answer each other's questions there, and to write with their own insights.
<b>Extra credit will be offered for particularly active participation.</b>
<p>
<b>Sign up for an account <a href="https://piazza.com/sc/fall2020/math141">here</a></b>.

<hr>
<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of illness or emergency.

Late homework will generally only be accepted in case of illness or emergency, but please ask me if you have special circumstances.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Accommodations </b> </font>:

<p> 

If you have a <b>disability</b> which requires any sort of accommodation please contact
<a href="https://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/">Student Disability Services</a>. They give recommendations to me,
and then I do whatever they say -- <b>provided that you provide notice at least
one week in advance.</b>
<p>


<font size=+1> <b> Honor Code </b> </font>:
<p>
It is imperative that you refrain from engaging in plagiarism, cheating, falsifying your work and/or assisting other students in violating the Honor Code. The honor code applies to all work for this course. Students should review the Honor Code
<a href="http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf625.pdf">here</a>.

<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:

<p>

Calculators will not be allowed for the exams. You may use them on the homework if you want, but this is discouraged,
as the purpose of the homework is to prepare you for the exams.
