<h2>Course objectives and learning outcomes:</h2>

<p>
<b>In Math 701 and 702, successful students will</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Master algebraic topics concerning groups, rings, fields, and other algebraic structures.
<p>
<li>More importantly, develop their sense of <i>algebraic thinking</i>, so that they can more easily
absorb additional algebraic material in the future.
<p>
<li>Lay the foundation for research in topics including algebraic number theory, algebraic combinatorics,
representation theory, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, algebraic topology, etc., etc., etc.
<p>
<li>Prepare for the Qualifying Exam in algebra.
</ul>
 
<h2>Course Textbooks:</h2>
In large part I will closely be following <b>Dummit and Foote</b>'s <i>Abstract Algebra</i>. I encourage
to obtain a copy of the book and follow along.
<p>
There are a number of other excellent books on algebra as well. Perhaps the most interesting is 
<b>Lang</b>'s <i>Algebra</i>. In my opinion Lang's book is not very good for the beginner, but is excellent for someone
who has seen the material before and wants to review or see a different perspective. In particular,
it is great to read when you are studying for quals.

<h2>Course Requirements:</h2> 

<ul>
<li>(70%) Written homework assignments will be assigned at most weekly. Collaboration is strongly encouraged.
<p>
<li>(30%) There will be a final exam and one or more midterm exams, with questions
similar to what you may expect on the qualifying exams. All exams will be take-home,
pledged, closed book, and of at least three hours in duration.

<li>(10% -- Bonus) Regularly attend the 
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/alicial/grad_colloquium/">graduate colloquium</a>,
and/or the department colloquium or seminars in your mathematical area of interest.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Grading Scale:</h2>
<p>
(Shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/ballard/">Matt Ballard</a>.)

<ul>
<li><b>A</b>: You have a strong chance of passing the qualifying exam if you prepare reasonably. This also represents a strong foundation for learning further related topics.
<li><b>B+</b>: With additional effort, you should be able to pass the qualifying exam if you prepare. This represents a partial foundation for learning further related topics.

<li><b>B</b>: You have demonstrated some mastery of the subject material, but should
put in a lot of additional effort if you want to pass the qualifying exam or write
a thesis in a related area.

<li><b>&lt; B</b>: This indicates a serious problem.</ul>
