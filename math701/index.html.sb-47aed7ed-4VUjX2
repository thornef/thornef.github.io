Instructor: Frank Thorne, LeConte 317O, thorne [at] math [dot] sc [dot] edu.
<p>
Office hours: TBD.

<h2>Course objectives and learning outcomes:</h2>

<p>
<b>In Math 701 and 702, successful students will</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Master algebraic topics concerning groups, rings, fields, and other algebraic structures.
<p>
<li>More importantly, develop their sense of <i>algebraic thinking</i>, so that they can more easily
absorb additional algebraic material in the future.
<li>Lay the foundation for research in topics including algebraic number theory, algebraic combinatorics,
representation theory, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, algebraic topology, etc., etc., etc.
<li>Prepare for the Qualifying Exam in algebra.
</ul>
 
<h2>Course Textbooks:</h2>
In large part I will closely be following <b>Dummit and Foote</b>'s <i>Abstract Algebra</i>. I encourage
to obtain a copy of the book and follow along.
<p>
There are a number of other excellent books on algebra as well. Perhaps the most interesting is that by
<b>Lang</b>. In my opinion Lang's book is not very good for the beginner, but is excellent for someone
who has seen the material before and wants to review or see a different perspective. In particular,
it is great to read when you are studying for quals.

<h2>Course Requirements:</h2> 

<ul>
<li>(70%) Written homework assignments will be assigned at most weekly.
<p>
<li>(20%) Take-home final exam, which will be similar to this course's component of the
Ph.D. comprehensive exam. 
<p>
Students who have advanced to Ph.D. candidacy are excused from the exam (and may additionally be excused from the homework at the request of your thesis advisor).

<li>(10% -- Bonus) Regularly attend the 
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/alicial/grad_colloquium/">graduate colloquium</a>,


: the 
<a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/colloquia">department colloquium</a>,
the <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/algebra/seminar/index.html">algebra seminar</a>,
the <b>student algebra seminar</b>, and the <b>number theory seminar</b>. Truant
students will be given large quantities of calculus homeworks to grade.
</ul>

</ul>
<p>
<h2>Grading Scale:</h2>
<p>
(Shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/ballard/">Matt Ballard</a>.)

<ul>
<li><b>A</b>: You have a strong chance of passing the comprehensive exam if you prepare reasonably. This also represents a strong foundation for learning further related topics.
<li><b>B+</b>: With additional effort, you should be able to pass the comprehensive exam if you prepare. This represents a partial foundation for learning further related topics.

<li><b>B</b>: You have demonstrated some mastery of the subject material, but should
put in a lot of additional effort if you want to pass the comprehensive exam or write
a thesis in a related area.

<li><b>&lt; B</b>: You apparently spent the entire semester playing Pokemon Go.
</ul>


<p>
<h3>Homework Assignments:</h3> 
<p>
<a href="735-hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a>, due Wednesday, September 14.
<p>
<b>Homework 2</b>, due Friday, September 30: Ch. 2, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10; Ch. 3, 2, 3, 12. Also verify the that the Lie bracket [X, Y] = XY - YX satisfies the Jacobi identity. You should do this once in your life, so if you have ever proved this no need to do it again.
<p>
<b>Homework 3</b>, due Wednesday, October 26: Ch. 4, 1-4, 12. 
<p><h2>Lecture Notes:</h2> 
<p>
<a href="lie1-3.pdf">Lectures 1-3</a>: introduction, examples of Lie groups, restriction of scalars.
<p>
<a href="lie4-5.pdf">Lectures 4-5</a>. 
<p>
<a href="lie6-10.pdf">Lectures 6-10</a>. 
<p>
<a href="lie11-16.pdf">Lectures 11-16</a>. 
<p>
<a href="lie17-25.pdf">Lectures 17-25</a>.

<h2>I love this subject. What should I study next?</h2>
<p>
If you enjoyed learning about Lie groups, I would recommend learning about related
topics such as <b>algebraic geometry</b>, <b>representation theory</b>, <b>algebraic groups</b>, and <b>differential geometry</b>. My work touches on these topics, but
faculty members whose work is even more relevant include
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/howard/">Ralph Howard</a>,
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/kassj/">Jesse Kass</a>,
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/ballard/">Matt Ballard</a>,
and <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/duncan/">Alex Duncan</a>. If you want to meet
these people, show up to the <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/algebra/seminar/index.html">algebra seminar</a>, come early for the pretalk, join me in the peanut gallery, and ask lots of questions.
