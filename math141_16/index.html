<p>
<b>Welcome to Math 141!</b> Calculus is a beautiful, important, challenging, and fascinating subject.

<HR>
<p>
<font size=+1>
<b>Under construction.</b> The homework assignments below are <b>last year's</b>
and need to be updated. The first homework, however, <b>is the same</b> and
is due Monday, August 29.

<font size=+1> <b> Instructional Staff </b> </font>:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Instructor:</b> Frank Thorne, LeConte 417O, thorne [at] math.sc.edu.
<br>
Office Hours: Monday 3:45-4:45, Tuesday and Friday 9:00 - 10:00.
<p>
(Note: I might have to reschedule these for meetings and such)

<p> 
<li><b>Teaching Assistant:</b> 
<br>
Jacob Juillerat, LeConte 107, juillerj [at] math.sc.edu 
<br>
The TA will hold discussion sections and
office hours and grade the homeworks. His job is to help you get through the course.
<br>
<p>
Office Hours: Monday 1:00-2:00, Tuesday and Thursday 2:45-3:45.
<p>
<li><b>Supplemental Instructor:</b> Mallory Bradberry, wmb [at] email.sc.edu.
<br>
The <i>supplemental instructor</i> is an undergraduate who has done very well in Math 141 in the past.
He/she will attend all the lectures and is here to help.
<br>
In place of office hours he/she holds <b>SI sessions</b> (dates and times to be announced) that you can go to.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul>
<li>Have ample opportunities to practice and use <b>algebra and trigonometry</b>, further increasing their skills in these areas. <b>Algebra
is an absolute prerequisite for calculus</b>, but at the same time the course will be directed towards students whose algebra skills may
be <b>slightly</b> rusty and in need of practice.
<li>Understand <b>quantitative data</b> and its presentation. In calculus, this usually takes the shape of a 
<b>function</b>. Functions will be presented in terms of equations, or in terms of graphs,
or in English text, and students will be required to <b>seamlessly translate</b> between these.
<li>Develop the ability to explain their work clearly. As with the previous bullet point, this 
will involve a combination of equations, graphs, and English text. <b>Students are expected to learn to write well.</b>
<li>Understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to give <b>precise definitions</b>
as well as <b>informal explanations</b> and will be able to <b>explain the correspondence.</b>
<li>Tackle problems that require more than one step to solve, or whose solution is not obvious. Typically this means that you <b>try
something</b>, and <b>if it doesn't work you try something else.</b>
</ul>
This could describe any math class. Typically, all of this is best learned in some <i>specific</i> context. Therefore,
successful students will also:
<ul>
<li>
Master concepts and problems involving limits, derivatives, integrals, and applications of all of the above.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning. There is a ton of homework. It will be collected and graded.</b> That is because this is the most effective way for you
to learn. But:
<ul>
<li>
This class has
a 12-point curve (i.e. A=88, B=76, etc.) as opposed to the usual ten point curve. My standards are high and so I think it is fair
that you should have more wiggle room. 
<li>
All of the assignments for this course, including a complete list of questions that may
show up on the exams, are posted below. So <b>everything is completely predictable</b>, and you can look before you leap.
<li>
<b>My goal is that you will earn the highest grades of any 141 class.</b> To that end, I've made my expectations
very clear -- the standards are high, but you can meet them and it is my job to help you.
<li>
If the numerical average on any midterm exam is at least 76%, then we will have a pizza lunch (in class) the day I hand back the exams.
</ul>

<font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
Thomas, <i> Calculus, Early Transcendentals, </i> 13th edition. 
The book is available for $141.15 from the campus bookstore; although high, this price represents a substantial
discount which our department negotiated with the publisher. The book is bundled with access to MyMathLab, which
will not be used in this section of 141. The same book will also be (presumably) used
for 142 and 241.

This is the same as the book used last year. Also, although the bookstore's books have
a special cover, my understanding is that the book is identical to "non-custom editions"
available elsewhere. So you are also welcome to obtain the book elsewhere if you can find it.

<p>
I also highly recommend
<a href="http://djm.cc/library/Calculus_Made_Easy_Thompson.pdf">
Calculus Made Easy</a> by Silvanus Thompson.
If nothing else, read the epilogue on p. 283.


<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Meeting schedule </b> </font>:
<ul>
<li><b>Lectures (Sections 5/6):</b> MWF, 10:50-11:40, LC 412.
<li><b>Maple Lab and Recitation:</b> T, LeConte 303A and R, LeConte 115. Either
8:30 or 10:05 depending on your section.
</ul>

<font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>: 
<ul>
<li><b>Precalculus Exam</b> (half exam, really more of a long quiz), discussion section in the second week. Will be dropped from your final average if this improves your grade.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 1:</b> September 21 in class.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 2:</b> October 21 in class.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 3:</b> November 16 in class.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> Wednesday, December 7, 9:00 a.m.
</ul>
All exams will be held in the usual classroom (LC 412).
<p>
<b>All questions on all exams will be taken verbatim from the homeworks.</b>
(The required and `additional' problems are both fair game.)
<p>
<b>See below for last year's midterm exams (with solutions) and four practice final exams.</b> You can also
see <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/thornef/math141_15/">here</a>, 
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/thornef/math141_12/">here</a>,
and 
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/thornef/math141_11/">here</a> for websites from previous semesters. You can find
more old exams there.
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:

Homework is due to your TA by 5:00 p.m., on Fridays except as otherwise noted below. (Your TA will tell you where to turn in your homework.)
The homework <b>will be graded and returned to you,</b> according to the following scheme. Each homework is
worth 10 points. Out of that, three problems will be selected each week (randomly, for the most part) and graded
carefully, and each is worth 2 points. The remaining 4 points are for overall quality and completion.
<p>
<b>All the homework assignments</b> can be downloaded from this website (see below).
<b>They are long.</b> Do not start the night before.<b>They are also very important.</b>
<p>
Each homework will have ''required'' and ''additional'' problems. The additional problems are
not required; it is recommended that you check that you know how to do them, and they might appear on exams.
<p>
<b>All exam problems will be taken verbatim from the homework assignments.</b>
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
The grade cutoffs are: A for 88%, B+ for 84%, B for 76%, C+ for 72%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.

<p>
Only <b>your highest two</b> midterm exam grades will be counted. Also, the above does not include the precalculus
exam the week of August 31. This exam will be counted 10% or 0% of your total, whichever makes your grade turn out higher.

<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

Late homework will generally not be accepted, but please ask your TA if you have special circumstances.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Disability accommodations </b> </font>:

<p> 

If you have a disability which requires any sort of accommodation please contact
<a href="https://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/">Student Disability Services</a>. I am very happy to follow their
recommendations, and to schedule alternate exams if need be, provided that you provide notice at least
one week in advance.
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:

<p>

Calculators will not be allowed for the exams. You may use them on the homework if you want, but this is discouraged,
as the purpose of the homework is to prepare you for the exams.
