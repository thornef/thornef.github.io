Please work without books, notes, calculators, or any assistance from others. If you have
any questions, feel free to ask me. 

Please do your work on separate paper; you should staple this sheet to your work (put this on top)
and turn in everything together.

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
Sketch a rough graph of the number of hours of daylight as a function of the time
of the year. (Explain your graph.)

\item
Graph the function $y = (x + 2)^4 + 3$, not by plotting points, but by
starting with the graph of $y = x^4$ and applying the appropriate transformations.
(Be sure to explicitly explain your work.)

\item
Explain what it means to say that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 1^-} f(x) = 3$
and $\lim_{x \rightarrow 1^+} f(x) = 7$. In this situation is it
possible that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 1} f(x)$ exists? Explain.

\item
Evaluate the limit
$$\lim_{h \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sqrt{1 + h} - 1}{h},$$
if it exists.
\item
Find the horizontal and vertical asymptotes of the curve
$$y = \frac{2x^2 + x - 1}{x^2 + x - 2}.$$

\item
Give the definition of the {\itshape derivative} of a function
$f(x)$ at the point $x = a$. (Please give the algebraic definition,
using an equation.)

Draw a picture and explain why your
equation gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$
at $x = a$.

\item
The graph of a function $g(x)$ is given. Arrange the
following numbers in increasing order and explain your reasoning.
$$0, \ \ \ g'(-2), \ \ \ g'(0), \ \ \ g'(2), \ \ \ g'(4)$$
\item
If $f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x$, find $f'(2)$ (directly from the definition 
of the derivative) and use it to find an equation of the tangent line
to the parabola $y = 3 x^2 - 5x$ at the point $(2, 2)$.

\end{enumerate}
