<p>
<b>Come on down!</b> Are you a fan of games shows such as <b>The Price is Right</b>,
<b>Who Wants to be a Millionaire</b>, <b>Let's Make a Deal</b>, <b>Jeopardy</b>, <b>Deal or No Deal</b>,
<b>Wheel of Fortune</b>, and more? Contestants on these shows are asked to make decisions which could
win or cost them a lot of money, and <b>mathematics can be used to figure out the best strategies.</b> This course
will explore these game shows while explaining the mathematics behind good decision-making.
<p>
Specific subjects to be covered include: probability and expected value; conditional probability and Bayesian inference;
and classical game theory. The course will also have a heavy modeling component: some games are too complicated
to analyze completely, but can be analyzed if you make some simplifying assumptions.
<p>
This class will teach real mathematics in a fun context. 
<p>
<b>Beware</b>: the class will require a lot of work, "fun" does not mean "easy"! Please plan on putting in the effort needed to succeed!

<h2>Covid-19 Safety:</h2>
<p>
Please:
<ul>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Don't come to class if you have Covid-19</b> (confirmed or suspected). Instead, contact me and ask me if it's possible to livesstream.
</font>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Masks are encouraged in class but not required.</b></font>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Masks may be required in my office</b> at times, depending
on the ongoing Covid situation. I will keep a supply of disposable face masks on hand
(or bring your own).
<li><font size="+1"><b>Classes will be livestreamed over Microsoft Teams</b> by request,
when possible, as needed. Class discussions and interactive activities can't really
be livestreamed, but when I'm lecturing this will be possible.
If you wake up with Covid symptoms let me know, stay home, and ask me to livestream
if possible. 
<li><font size="+1"><i>(Not required)</i> The <b>vaccine</b> is strongly recommended. You can get it
<a href="https://www.sc.edu/safety/coronavirus/testing_and_services/vaccine/index.php">
on campus</a>. Once available, getting an  Omicron-specific booster is also strongly recommended.</font>
</ul>

<FONT SIZE =+1> <B> Learning outcomes: </B> </Font>
<p>
<i>"Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten."</i> -- B.F. Skinner
<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul>
<li>Master the mathematical topics described above.
<li>Better understand how to apply mathematics in the real world. While it may be debated whether or not game shows
are the "real world", the real point is that math isn't in the statement of many of
the questions to be considered. Half the battle is knowing <i>
which math problems to solve</i>.
<li>Gain comfort with ambiguous questions. For example, you may be familiar with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0">Monty Hall Problem</a>. (If not,
don't worry, I'll explain it.) Should you switch doors? The correct answer is "it depends on what assumptions you make".
<li>Gain comfort with complicated problems. In courses like calculus we break everything up into bite-sized chunks for you.
This course will teach the use of a knife and fork.
<li>Practice your written and oral presentation skills. There will be a term project (see below).
<li>Have a lot of fun! I mean, how could you not? This subject is just cool.
</ul>

<font size=+2> <b> Course notes: </b></font>
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> <a href="gameshows-428.pdf">Here</a> </b></font> are the course notes, in their latest version from Spring 2018. 
<p>
Note that due to copyright concerns, some
of the Youtube links to video game clips may be dead. These will be replaced when 
possible, but I have no way of preventing links from disappearing.
<p>
The notes are subject to <b>frequent revision</b>. (Your feedback, as always,
will be welcome.)
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Meeting schedule </b> </font>: MWF 10:50-11:40, Callicott 301. Class
will be a combination of lecture, discussion, and interactive activities. 
<p>
If circumstances permit, there may be a special presentation (outside of class hours) by a guest speaker. If this happens, attendance will be expected unless you have a 
very good excuse. <hr>
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 
 
<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
You are guaranteed at least the following grades: A for 88%, B+ for 83%, B for 76%, C+ for 70%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.

<font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:
Homework will be assigned and graded up to weekly. You are welcome to work with others but you are responsible for your own
written solutions.
You are always welcome, and strongly encouraged, to come
to office hours or stick around after class, show me your written up solutions to homework problems, and ask
whether they are correct.
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Weekly Feedback </b> </font>:
I am developing this course from scratch; to my knowledge, my Fall 2016 course was the first time a university-level
course had been taught based on this.
<p>
As such, <b>you are responsible for helping me do a good job.</b> Every week (by Friday at 5:00 pm), an e-mail is due reflecting
on the lectures, course notes, and/or homework assignment. What are you struggling with? What do you enjoy, and what is boring?
Is there anything in the lecture notes which you don't think is adequately explained?
<p>
<b>Suggestions to improve the lecture notes are especially appreciated</b> -- as I have some aspiration of eventually turning these into a book. 
<p>
Being brief is okay, but you're expected to say something more substantial than "Good job, no comments!" Weeks without lectures
on all three days, and in addition you may skip at most two weeks.

This is not only for my benefit, but also very much for yours. Reflecting on your own learning will help you cement your
study habits and assist with retention of the material for years to come.
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Participation </b> </font>:
<b>Active participation in the course is also very important.</b> The most obvious (and most highly recommended) way to fulfill
this requirement is to actively participate in class discussions and ask questions during class. You may also fulfill this
requirement by periodically coming to office hours to ask questions, by e-mailing me with your questions, or by being
particularly thorough in your weekly feedback.
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Term Project </b> </font>:
You are also responsible for a <b>term project</b>. Generally, this will involve analyzing a game (or a part of a game),
writing a short paper on it, and making a 10-15 minute presentation to the class. You are welcome and encouraged 
to work in groups.
<p>
I recommend (but do not require) that you use software called <b>LaTeX</b> for writing
up your term project. <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/~huerta/latexforbeginners.html">Here</a> are some resources and some Windows downloads. If you use a Mac,
<a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/">this</a> is the software which I use
and which you can download.
<p>
<a href="gameshows-latex-sample.pdf">Here</a> is a sample of how your term project
might be formatted if you use LaTeX, together with a description of how to get
started using LaTeX. <a href="gameshows-latex-sample.tex">This</a> is the .tex
file which was used to produce this document, and 
<a href="gameshows-latex-sample.txt">here</a> is the same file renamed .txt, so that
a web browser will open it immediately.
<p>
 You can also download the TeX file
for the course notes above -- if you see something in the notes you want to imitate,
you can see how I did it.
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>: 
<ul>
<li><b>In-Class Midterm:</b> Date TBA, to be announced at least a week in advance. 
Here are examples of previous midterms from <a href="gameshows-midterm.pdf">2016</a> 
with solutions,</a> and <a href="gameshows-midterm-2018-sols.pdf">2018</a>,
again with solutions.
<p>
The drop deadline is November 2.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> Friday, December 9 at 9:00 am, in the usual classroom. The format
will be similar to the midterm, but longer.
</ul>
<p>
<hr>

<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Requirements: </b> </font> There are no formal prerequisites for the class. Indeed, the class
is designed especially for freshmen and/or non-STEM majors. Two guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Your high school math background -- in algebra, precalculus, and overall "mathematical maturity" should be strong.
A good guideline is that if you have not taken Honors Calculus I (Math 141H) or its equivalent already, you would feel confident
doing so.
<li>The course is not designed for students with an advanced university-level math background, and it has some redundancies
with our courses on probability and discrete math.
If you have taken any math course
at the 300 level or above, you should double check with me about what your expectations are.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Calculators are permitted</b> but not required, including on the exams. A four-function calculator is more than adequate;
graphing functionality won't be useful. Programming functionality is not permitted on the homework or exams. If you bring
a programmable calculator to the exams, you are bound by the Honor Code not to use this functionality.
<p>
<b>Access to the internet</b> is required. Many of the course videos will refer to clips from game shows which are on Youtube.
You must be able to watch these (with sound). Try the links below and make sure you can
see and hear everything.

<p>
Late homework <b>may</b> be accepted, especially if arranged in advance, but no guarantees are made, and repeated late homeworks will be accepted only in case of severe extenuating circumstances.
<p>
<b>Academic honesty</b> is expected of all students.
<P>
<b>Attendance</b> is required. Unexcused absence from more than 10% of classes may result in a penalty of up to 10% of the participation grade for each such absence.
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Accommodations </b> </font>:

<p>

Please contact the <a href="https://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/">Student Disability Resource Center</a> if you have any
sort of disability which requires any sort of accommodations. I am always happy to follow their recommendations; 
it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.

<p>

<b> Class Climate:</b>
<p>
It is my goal to create a welcoming classroom environment, free of racism, sexism, homo- or transphobia, discrimination, bullying, insults, or harassment. Please bring any concerns to me; major or repeated violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.

<P>

<hr>
<font size=+1> <b> Topics to be covered. </b> </font>
<p>
<b>This will be updated with much more detail as the course progresses.</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Probability. </b> You throw two dice. What is the probability they sum to eight? You deal yourself a poker hand.
What is the probability you deal yourself a royal flush? You play 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99XtKAtSOk0">Ten Chances</a> 
and guess at random. What is the probability you win the car?
<p>
Such computations are at the root of most of what we will do.
<li>
<p>
<b>Expectation. </b> The <i>expected value</i> of a game is the average amount of money you expect to win, with each possibility
weighted by its probability. You're playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhVir9fabLk">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</a>. Quit or keep going?
Do you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zooM074if0I">press your luck</a>?
<p>
We will also look at limitations to what the mathematics says about human behavior. Would you rather have $900,000, or a
one-in-ten chance at $10,000,000?
<li>
<b>Inference. </b> You pull a coin out of your pocket and flip it twenty times. It comes up heads each time. What is the probability
that it's a trick coin, with heads on both sides?
<p>
You actually can't answer this without making additional assumptions. We will discuss <b>Bayes' theorem</b> and <b>Bayesian inference</b> and watch old episodes of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCpXz9tk_o">Let's Make a Deal</a>.
We will of course discuss the <b>Monty Hall Problem</b>, which actually did not appear
on the show.
<p>
<li>
<b>Multi-Step Strategy. </b> You play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA05rA0YcLc">Cover Up</a>. What's the probability that you win the car?

What if you know what the first two digits are, and only have to guess the last three.
You should certainly pick the correct two digits on the first round. ..... right?

<li>
<p>
<b>Multi-player Strategy. </b> Special considerations are required if you are competing
with other players -- especially if you all play simultaneously.
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsWPOuF4Fk">Here</a> is a round of Final
Jeopardy. Perhaps an English class would be most helpful here, but
the math question here is: how much should you wager?
<li>
<p>
<b>Modeling. </b> Try and figure out the optimal strategy for 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvSMVAuGpAE">Switcheroo.</a>
I dare you. (The rabbit hole runs very deep.) You are going to have to make
some simplfiying assumptions if you want to get started at all. Which are useful to
make?
<li>
<p>
<b>Student Presentations and Conclusion.</b>
