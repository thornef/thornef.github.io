Successful students will:
<ul>
<li>
Review, solidify, and build upon concepts first learned in Math 241 (Multivariable Calculus). 
<li>
Understand the geometry of vectors, vector fields, and vector-valued functions in Euclidean space.
<li>
Master extensions of the differentiation and integration operations to multivariate and vector-valued functions.
<li>
Master the perspective of differentiation as a <i>linear map on tangent spaces</i>.
<li>
Understand the multivariate generalizations of the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus: theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes -- together with the "Generalized Stokes Theorem".
<li>
Learn the basics of differential geometry: manifolds, differential forms, curvature, and the like.
<li>
Understand applications of all of the above to physics, including Kepler's laws and the Maxwell equations.
<li>
Continue developing fluency in abstract, rigorous mathematics -- preparing 
the student for study of more advanced topics.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Warning.</b> You should expect 5-8 hours of homework a week in this class, which is more than most other instructors assign; 
in my experience there is no other way to learn the material. Your consistent effort will certainly lead to improved understanding,
and it will almost certainly lead to you earning high grades.
<P>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
Susan Jane Colley, <i>Vector Analysis</i>, <b>Third</b> Edition. It is recommended that you buy used online, for example from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0131858742/ref=dp_olp_all_mbc?ie=UTF8&condition=all">Amazon</a>. If you buy from the campus bookstore, you will pay much more. 
<p>
<b>I anticipate covering the entire text,</b> except for any material which I presume you already know from 241.
The text will also be supplemented with additional material, for which lecture notes will be made available. <b>This will be on the homework and exams too.</b>
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Lectures </b> </font>:
LeConte 303B, MWF, 9:40-10:30 am.

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>:
There will be two two-hour midterms, and the registrar-scheduled final exam. Midterms will be <b>take home, pledged, and closed-book and closed-notes.</b> Dates that the exams will be passed out will be announced at least one week in advance, and you will have a week to do each midterm.

<p>
The final exam will be two and a half hours, with the same format as the midterms. The final exam will be distributed on Monday, April 27 <b>and is due by the end of the day on Tuesday, May 5.</b>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: On both homework and exams, you will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. Indeed, a major
focus of Math 550 is the ability to communicate mathematical ideas clearly.
<b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
In particular, please write in <b>complete English sentences</b> and draw <b>clear diagrams</b> where appropriate.

Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.
<p>
<b>Grading scale</b>: You are guaranteed at least an A for 85+, B+ for 80+, B for 70+, C+ for 65+, C for 50+, and D for 40+.
<b>These are wider margins that the usual 10-point scale.</b> But be warned that I will be fairly strict, and that some problems will be difficult.

<p>
Homework will be due approximately once a week. Late homework will only be accepted in case of illness, emergency, or university-sanctioned event (in which case you should clear it with me <b>beforehand</b>).


<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Contacting me </b> </font>:

<b>Please contact me if you have any questions about the course, about my expectations, about my lectures,
about the homeworks, about the reading, or about anything else</b>. The syllabus is demanding and it is my
job to help you succeed.

The best ways to get help are to come to office hours (no appointment necessary) or to e-mail me (I will
usually reply within 24 hours). If neither of these work for you then please e-mail me to set up an
appointment.
<p>
<i>Please note:</i> If you come to office hours, please don't be shy about interrupting me! I'm usually in
the middle of something, but it can wait.

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Other policies </b> </font>:

<p>
<b>Academic honesty</b> and <b>attendance</b> are expected of all students.
<P>
On homeworks, collaboration is encouraged, but you should write up your own solution. The basic guideline is: <b>when writing up your solutions, you should not be looking at another student's solution.</b> If another student explains to you how to solve a problem, that is okay, but you should then reproduce this solution without copying theirs.
<p>
If you have a documented disability, or otherwise need special arrangements, then let me know and I will work to accommodate your needs. <b>If you need any sort of special treatment, you should let me know at least one week in advance.</b>

<p>
Exams should be your own work exclusively.
<p>
<b>Calculators</b> will not be needed or allowed on exams. You may use them <i>sparingly</i> on homeworks -- but don't rely on them!

</ul>
