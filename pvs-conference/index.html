        </p>
        <p>
          Prehomogeneous vector spaces are a fascinating subject -- with connections to representation theory,
analytic number theory, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, and arithmetic statistics. The subject
was initiated in Japan, through the seminal work of Mikio Sato, Tatsuo Kimura, Takuro Shintani, and others.
Important work on this subject by many Japanese mathematicians continues.
<p>
The subject is also very popular in North America, where the work of Manjul Bhargava and many others has opened up 
new connections to number theory and arithmetic statistics. These connections are the subject of much ongoing work.
<p>
The purpose of this conference is to bring together mathematicians from Japan, North America, and elsewhere, and to expand
the audience for recent ongoing work in the subject.

          <span>Timing and Details</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The conference will consist of four 90-minute talks, one a day, held at the following dates and times:
            <li><b>In Japan</b>: July 7-10, 9:00-10:30am.
            <li><b>In North America</b>: July 6-9, 5:00-6:30pm (PST), 8:00-9:30pm (EST). 
            </li>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.1cm;">

The timing is chosen to allow Japanese and North American audiences to participate live, and to interact with each
other. 
<p style="margin-bottom:0.1cm;">
Apologies to our friends in Europe, Africa, and Western Asia, for whom the conference will happen in the middle of the night.
And also to those for whom the dinner hour is bad timing. If possible, we hope to provide recordings of the lectures,
with subtitles in both English and Japanese.
<p>
<b>Format of the talks</b>: Each talk will start with about 45 minutes of background, overview, and motivation, aimed
at a general audience. After a 10 minute break, the speaker will
conclude with ~30 minutes explaining their work in more detail.
<p>
Please feel free to participate in one or both parts depending on your background and interests.
