\begin{enumerate}
\item (0 points)
Write down some random binary quadratic forms and some random matrices in $\textnormal{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$,
and compute their actions on your binary quadratic forms. Ponder and admire your results before
throwing them in the wastebasket.

\item (5 points)
Evaluate $h(d)$ for $d = -11, -15, -24, -163$.

\item (5 points)
Prove that the action of $\textnormal{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ leaves the discriminant unchanged.

\item (3 points)
Prove directly (i.e., without using Gauss's theory) 
that the quadratic forms $2 x^2 + xy + 3y^2$ and $2 x^2 - xy + 3 y^2$ are
not equivalent.

\item (3 points)
Prove directly that the quadratic forms $x^2 + xy + y^2$ and $x^2 - xy + y^2$
are equivalent.

\item (8 points; hints to be added later)
(Gauss's reduction theory) Prove that every positive definite quadratic form with $a, c > 0$ is equivalent to
a unique ``reduced'' form satisfying $-a < b \leq a < c$ or $0 \leq b \leq a = c$.

\item (8 points)
Prove that the number of automorphs of a binary quadratic form is: 6 if $d = -3$, 4 if $d = -4$,
and 2 for any other negative $d$.

\item (5+ points)
Using a computer, evaluate $h(-d)$ for $1 < d < 10^6$, and describe and explain your results.

\item (???)
Prove that $h(d) > 1$ if $d < -163$.
