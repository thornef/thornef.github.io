<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Frank Thorne - Spring 2018<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>University of South Carolina<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Come on down!</b> Are you a fan of games shows such as <b>The Price is Right</b>, <b>Who Wants to be a Millionaire</b>, <b>Let's Make a Deal</b>, <b>Jeopardy</b>, <b>Deal or No Deal</b>, <b>Wheel of Fortune</b>, and more? Contestants on these shows are asked to make decisions which could win or cost them a lot of money, and <b>mathematics can be used to figure out the best strategies.</b> This course will explore these game shows while explaining the mathematics behind good decision-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Specific subjects to be covered include: probability and expected value; conditional probability and Bayesian inference; and classical game theory. The course will also have a heavy modeling component: some games are too complicated to analyze completely, but can be analyzed if you make some simplifying assumptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This class will teach real mathematics in a fun context. (Beware: "fun" does not mean easy.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Instructor </b>: Frank Thorne, LeConte 317O, thorne [at] math.sc.edu.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Office Hours: Wednesday, 3:30-5:00; Thursday, 9:00-10:30. I am also frequently (but not always) available immediately after class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Exception</b>: There are Faculty Senate Meetings on Wednesdays -- February 7, March 7, and April 4. Wednesday office hours these weeks will be moved to Tuesdays.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Learning outcomes:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i>"Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten."</i> -- B.F. Skinner<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Successful students will:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Master the mathematical topics described above.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Better understand how to apply mathematics in the real world. While it may be debated whether or not game shows are the "real world", the real point is that math isn't in the statement of many of the questions to be considered. Half the battle is knowing <i>which math problems to solve</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Gain comfort with ambiguous questions. For example, you may be familiar with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0"><span class="s3">Monty Hall Problem</span></a>. (If not, don't worry, I'll explain it.) Should you switch doors? The correct answer is "it depends on what assumptions you make".<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Gain comfort with complicated problems. In courses like calculus we break everything up into bite-sized chunks for you. This course will teach the use of a knife and fork.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Practice your written and oral presentation skills. There will be a term project (see below).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Have a lot of fun! I mean, how could you not? This subject is just cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

<p class="p12"><span class="s5"><b>Homework </b></span><span class="s1">: Homework will be assigned and graded up to weekly. You are welcome to work with others but you are responsible for your own written solutions. You are always welcome, and strongly encouraged, to come to office hours or stick around after class, show me your written up solutions to homework problems, and ask whether they are correct.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s5"><b>Weekly Feedback </b></span><span class="s1">: I am developing this course from scratch; to my knowledge, my Fall 2016 course was the first time a university-level course had been taught based on this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">As such, <b>you are responsible for helping me do a good job.</b> Every week (by Friday at 5:00 pm), an e-mail is due reflecting on the lectures, course notes, and/or homework assignment. What are you struggling with? What do you enjoy, and what is boring? Is there anything in the lecture notes which you don't think is adequately explained?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Suggestions to improve the lecture notes are especially appreciated</b> -- as I have some aspiration of eventually turning these into a book.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Being brief is okay, but you're expected to say something more substantial than "Good job, no comments!" Weeks without lectures on all three days, and in addition you may skip at most two weeks. This is not only for my benefit, but also very much for yours. Reflecting on your own learning will help you cement your study habits and assist with retention of the material for years to come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s5"><b>Participation </b></span><span class="s1">: <b>Active participation in the course is also very important.</b> The most obvious (and most highly recommended) way to fulfill this requirement is to actively participate in class discussions and ask questions during class. You may also fulfill this requirement by periodically coming to office hours to ask questions, by e-mailing me with your questions, or by being particularly thorough in your weekly feedback.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s5"><b>Term Project </b></span><span class="s1">: You are also responsible for a <b>term project</b>. Generally, this will involve analyzing a game (or a part of a game), writing a short paper on it, and making a 10-15 minute presentation to the class. You are welcome and encouraged to work in groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I recommend (but do not require) that you use software called <b>LaTeX</b> for writing up your term project. <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/~huerta/latexforbeginners.html"><span class="s3">Here</span></a> are some resources and some Windows downloads. If you use a Mac, <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/"><span class="s3">this</span></a> is the software which I use and which you can download.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><a href="file:///Volumes/thornef/schc212/gameshows-latex-sample.pdf">Here</a></span><span class="s1"> is a sample of how your term project might be formatted if you use LaTeX, together with a description of how to get started using LaTeX. <a href="file:///Volumes/thornef/schc212/gameshows-latex-sample.tex"><span class="s3">This</span></a> is the .tex file which was used to produce this document, and <a href="file:///Volumes/thornef/schc212/gameshows-latex-sample.txt"><span class="s3">here</span></a> is the same file renamed .txt, so that a web browser will open it immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You can also download the TeX file for the course notes above -- if you see something in the notes you want to imitate, you can see how I did it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s5"><b>Requirements: </b></span><span class="s1">There are no formal prerequisites for the class. Indeed, the class is designed especially for freshmen and/or non-STEM majors. Two guidelines:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Your high school math background -- in algebra, precalculus, and overall "mathematical maturity" should be strong. A good guideline is that if you have not taken Honors Calculus I (Math 141H) or its equivalent already, you would feel confident doing so.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The course is not designed for students with an advanced university-level math background, and it has some redundancies with our courses on probability and discrete math. If you have taken any math course at the 300 level or above, you should double check with me about what your expectations are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Calculators are permitted</b> but not required, including on the exams. A four-function calculator is more than adequate; graphing functionality won't be useful. Programming functionality is not permitted on the homework or exams. If you bring a programmable calculator to the exams, you are bound by the Honor Code not to use this functionality.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Access to the internet</b> is required. Many of the course videos will refer to clips from game shows which are on Youtube. You must be able to watch these (with sound). Try the links below and make sure you can see and hear everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Make-up policy </b></span><span class="s6">:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam. Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Accommodations </b></span><span class="s6">:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Please contact the <a href="https://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/"><span class="s3">Student Disability Resource Center</span></a> if you have any sort of disability which requires any sort of accommodations. I am always happy to follow their recommendations; it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"><b>Rough schedule of topics to be covered.</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>This will be updated with much more detail as the course progresses.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Probability. </b>You throw two dice. What is the probability they sum to eight? You deal yourself a poker hand. What is the probability you deal yourself a royal flush? You play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99XtKAtSOk0"><span class="s3">Ten Chances</span></a> and guess at random. What is the probability you win the car? Such computations are at the root of most of what we will do. <br>

We will also look at limitations to what the mathematics says about human behavior. Would you rather have $900,000, or a one-in-ten chance at $10,000,000? <br>

  <li class="li9"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Inference. </b>You pull a coin out of your pocket and flip it twenty times. It comes up heads each time. What is the probability that it's a trick coin, with heads on both sides? You actually can't answer this without making additional assumptions. We will discuss <b>Bayes' theorem</b> and <b>Bayesian inference</b> and watch old episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCpXz9tk_o"><span class="s3">Let's Make a Deal</span></a>. We will of course discuss the <b>Monty Hall Problem</b>, which actually did not appear on the show. <br>
