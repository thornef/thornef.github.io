<p>
<b>Welcome to Math 374!</b> Discrete Mathematics is a beautiful, important, and fascinating subject. This course is designed to
give you a broad background in topics such as propositional logic, proof by induction, elementary combinatorics, and
asymptotic analysis. The course is designed to be especially useful for students majoring in computer science and related topics.
<p>
It is also challenging. Please plan on a lot of hard work; I am here to help you succeed.

<b> Instructor </b>: Frank Thorne, LeConte 317O, thorne [at] math.sc.edu.

<i>"Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten."</i> -- B.F. Skinner
<p>
Successful students will learn the basics of a variety of topics within discrete mathematics (please see the schedule below for
a complete list), with an eye towards their applications in computer science. The course will involve and further develop some
proof-writing ability, but this will not be the principal focus of this course.

Susanna Epp, <i> Discrete Mathematics with Applications, </i> 4th edition.
<p>
The campus bookstore has committed to selling the book for $150.00. 
You <i>should</i> be able to purchase this book for $150.00, although it was not available for this price on the first

<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
You are guaranteed at least the following grades: A for 90%, B+ for 85%, B for 78%, C+ for 72%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.

<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:

<p>
Calculators will not be needed or allowed for the exams or quizzes.
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Attendance </b> </font>:
Skipping class is unwise, but no attendance policy will be enforced. You are
responsible for all the material covered in all lectures and homework problems, and you must
be present in class for a quiz to take it.
