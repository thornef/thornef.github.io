The number of non-S_5 quintic extensions of bounded discriminant</a>,
with Manjul Bhargava and Alina Carmen Cojocaru.
<p>

<b>At an intermediate stage:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Voronoi summation formulae related to the Shintani zeta function and applications for twisted averages</i>,
with Lillian Pierce.
<p>
The object of the paper is as in the title. We are largely finished with a Voronoi summation formula;
currently, we are working on variations and applications (in combination with exponential sum bounds,
the circle method, and/or related techniques)
<li>
<i>Weighted average of class numbers for quadratic fields</i>, with
Leo Goldmakher, Wei Ho, Kevin McGown, and Jennifer Park.
<p>
We are working on parametrization and counting theorems for one of the space
of pairs of quaternary alternating 2-forms (considered by Bhargava in Higher Composition Laws I).
<li>
<i>Secondary terms in counting functions for cubic fields, II</i>, with Manjul Bhargava and Takashi Taniguchi.
<p>
We have brought the error term in the Davenport-Heilbronn theorem (for cubic fields) down to X^(2/3), by
a synthesis of our previous methods. We are currently in the process of proving results for 3-torsion in class
groups of quadratic fields, and for relative cubic extensions of quadratic fields.
<li>
<i>Singular exponential sums associated to prehomogeneous vector spaces over finite fields</i>, with Takashi
Taniguchi.
<p>
We investigate the Fourier transforms of the characteristic functions of certain exponential sums
associated to prehomogeneous vector spaces over finite fields (referred to as `cubic Gauss sums' in the binary
cubic case, in our previous work).

We lay out a program for evaluating these Fourier transforms, much more simply than we had done in the past.
We have computed a variety of examples, including the case of pairs of ternary quadratic forms. As a consequence,
we will prove that there are >> X/log(X) quartic fields with almost-prime discriminant less than X. (The precise
definition of `almost prime' is yet to be made precise.)
<p>
<li>
<i>What is the height of 2 points in the plane?</i>, with Jesse Kass.
<p>
We are currently investigating the distribution of rational points on the Hilbert scheme of two points. The results
depend on the divisor used to embed the scheme into projective space, and we obtain
an asymptotic density theorem for a portion of the ample cone.
<p>
<li>
<i>
2-torsion in class groups of number field fields and integral points on elliptic curves</i>,with M. Bhargava, A. Shankar, T. Taniguchi, J. Tsimerman, and Y. Zhao.
<p>
The output of an AIM SQuaRE workshop. We prove/improve power saving bounds on the 2-torsion in class groups of any number field,
on the number of A_4-quartic fields of bounded discriminant, 
and on the number of integral points on elliptic curves.
