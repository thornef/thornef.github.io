{\bf Due by the final exam}

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
Do Exercises 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in Chapter 16. (These are the exercises in the middle of the chapter,
not the problems at the end of the section.)

{\bf Bonus problems.} (Not as hard as they look!)
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
In this problem you will find {\bf all} integer solutions to the equation $x^2 + 2y^2 = z^2$. Your proof
will be {\bf stunningly beautiful} and will demonstrate that {\bf an ellipse is birational over $\mathbb{Q}$ to
a line.}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Explain why it is enough to find all {\itshape rational} solutions to $x^2 + 2y^2 = 1$.
\item
Graph the ellipse $x^2 + 2y^2 = 1$ and the line $x = 1$.
\item
Explain why any line through the point $(-1, 0)$, other than the vertical line, intersects the ellipse
$x^2 + 2y^2 = 1$ and the line $x = 1$ each at exactly one point.
\item
Suppose that $(a, b)$ is a point on $x^2 + 2y^2 = 1$ with $a$ and $b$ rational. Draw $(a, b)$ on your graph.
Graph the line between $(-1, 0)$ and $(a, b)$ and find its equation. Find the intersection point $(1, c)$
with $c = 1$, and verify that it is rational.
\item
Suppose that $(1, c)$ is a point on $x = 1$ with $c$ rational. Draw $(1, c)$ on your graph.
Graph the line between $(-1, 0)$ and $(1, c)$ and find its equation. Find the intersection point $(a, b)$
with $x^2 + 2y^2 = 1$, and verify that both $a$ and $b$ are rational.
\item
Explain why this gives a correspondence between rational solutions $(a, b)$ to $x^2 + 2y^2 = 1$ and rational
numbers $c$.
\item
Plugging in a few small values of $c$, find a few integral solutions to the equation $x^2 + 2y^2 = z^2$.
\end{enumerate}

\item
Now, do the same for the equation $x^2 - y^2 = z^2$. Abbreviated instructions:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Explain why it is enough to find rational points on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 1$. Graph this hyperbola.
\item
In this problem, the line $x = 0$ takes the place of $x = 1$, and the point $(1, 0)$ takes the place of $(-1, 0)$.
As before, find a correspondence between rational solutions $(a, b)$ to $x^2 - y^2 = 1$ and points $(0, -c)$ on the
line. This time, to make your life easier, restrict your attention to positive $a, b, c$ with $c > 1$.
\item
As before, find a few solutions to $x^2 - y^2 = z^2$. Although our work feels new here, it is entirely redundant
with something we did before! Explain why.
