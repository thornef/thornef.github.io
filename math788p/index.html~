<p>
Math 788P is a second course in algebraic number theory, following Michael's
introduction in Fall 2012. It is intended to give students an introduction to
the language, tools, and power of modern algebraic number theory. As such we will
develop much of the "highbrow" algebraic theory.

<p>
<b>Prerequisites.</b> Michael's algebraic number theory course or equivalent, or a willingness to do extra
work on the side. Abstract algebra; students should have taken 703/704 or their equivalent, or be enrolled
in them concurrently. (Some material uses Galois theory; this will be taught after Matt covers it in 704.)
<p>
<b>Grading.</b> There will be a variety of long homework assignments totalling at least 400 points.
The grading scale is A = 200+, B = 140+, giving students flexibility to choose problems matching their
background, interests, and curiosity. Students writing their dissertations may be excused from part of the
workload (if arranged in advance) at the discretion of the instructor.
<p>
There was a <a href="midterm.pdf">midterm exam</a> held on April 1, 2013.
<p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
The class will meet 12:20-1:10, MWF.

Due to my travel obligations,
class is cancelled on the following dates: March 1, March 8, March 18, March 20, April 10 through April 17.
<p>
<b>Extra classes</b>: To make up for the cancelled classes, we will have an extra class on Tuesday most (but not all)
weeks, starting on January 29. The extra classes will be out of the stream of the MWF classes, and will cover a variety
of additional topics: adeles and ideles, proof of the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, Galois theory of valuations, the idelic
proof of finiteness of the class number, Tate's thesis, Artin L-functions, the Scholz reflection principle, and/or whatever
else I decide is cool. These classes will be in seminar style, allowing you to see a variety of interesting advanced topics.
<p>
The material covered in the Tuesday classes will not appear on the comprehensive exam.  
<p>
<h2>Homework</h2>
Late homework will be accepted, although discouraged. Please do not turn in a large stack of homework at the end of the
semester.

<h2>Topics to be covered:</h2>
<p>
Note: The list of references to be covered is not exhaustive; most of the references cover all the topics, I have tried
to pick the ones which I anticipate relying on the most.
<ul>
<li> <b>The p-adic numbers.</b> (4 weeks) Introduced by Kurt Hensel, 
the p-adic numbers allow us to look ``one prime at a time'' and are ubiquitous in
modern algebraic number theory. We will carefully look at their algebraic and topological properties.

We will also prove the <i>Hasse-Minkowski theorem</i>, the first example of a <i> local-to-global</i> principle for the solution
of Diophantine equations, which will help motivate the study of the $p$-adics.
<p>
References: Gouvea, Neukirch, Milne, Serre.

<li> <b>The geometry of numbers.</b> (4 weeks.) One way of understanding number fields is to regard their rings of integers as a lattice. We will
carry out this construction and learn what insight it gives us. We will study the <b>discriminants</b> and <b>class groups</b> 
of number fields, and prove classical bounds on these quantities. We will also see (in principle, at least) how to compute the class group
of any number field.

We might have an entire graduate course on this subject in 2013-2014; if so, then I will abbreviate my treatment. 
<p>
References: Neukirch, Marcus.

<li> <b>The decomposition of prime ideals in extensions.</b> (4 weeks.) A classical topic in algebraic number theory, due to Hilbert,
is how prime ideals split in extensions. They can `split', be `inert', or `ramify'. We will learn what this means and see what it has
to do with classical questions. For example, a classical result (probably proved in Filaseta's course) gives a concise description of
the integers which can be written as a sum of two squares. We will see how this can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert's theory.
<p>
I think Michael covered some of this material in his course, but without the modern language and theory. So, this will build on Michael did.
We will develop the (very beautiful) connections with Galois theory and discuss the all-important <i>Frobenius element</i>, and at some
point I will mumble the word "Spec", draw a bunch of points on the blackboard, and claim that they are an <i>algebraic curve</i>.
<p>
References: Neukirch, Milne.

<li>
<b> Valuations and their extensions.</b> (depending on time) There is another approach to Hilbert's ramification theory, via the theory
of valuations, corresponding to extensions of the $p$-adic numbers. This is the true highbrow approach to algebraic number theory, as it 
allows us to study number fields globally by looking at their local properties. In other words, <i>think globally, act locally</i>. 
<p>
Reference: Neukirch.

<li> <b>Tate's thesis.</b> (depending on time and interest) we will look at John Tate's visionary 1951 Princeton thesis, which
combined algebraic number theory with analytic. Tate started with the $p$-adic numbers and combined all of them to form the <i>
ring of adeles</i>, and observed that this was an excellent space on which to do harmonic analysis. This led to a beautiful proof of
the functional equation of the Riemann zeta functions (and more generally, of Hecke $L$-functions). Later, it led to a huge variety
of generalizations (e.g. the Langlands program), many of them conjectural, and all of them very important and widely studied. 
We will see what it was that Tate did.
<p>
Reference: Tate (in Cassels-Frohlich).
<p>
<li> <b>Class field theory</b>. We will finish our course with the crowning achievement of algebraic number theory.
The basic theorem of class field theory provides an isomorphism between the class group of a number
field $K$, and the Galois group of its maximal abelian unramified extension, called the Artin map. We will look at this
theorem and its generalizations. The proofs are notoriously difficult, so we will instead focus on understanding the theorems 
and their applications.
