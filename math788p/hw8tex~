{\itshape Note: Any homework turned in after Thursday, May 2 at noon should be sent to me by e-mail,
so I can grade it from the road.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (10 points)
Summarize what you learned in Robert Lemke Oliver's talk.

\item (10 points)
Robert's paper is available here:
\begin{center}
\url{http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~rlemkeo/papers/08MultiplicativeArtin.pdf}
\end{center}
Elaborate on his Example 1, give more thorough justification of the algebraic number theory claims being made.

\item (15 points)
Do this same for Example 3.

\item (5 points)
Determine, with proof, the Galois group of $x^4 - 2x^2 + 2x^2 + 2x - 1$.

\item (10 points)
Determine, with proof, the Galois group of 
$x^5 + x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.

\item (10 points)
Determine the Galois group of
$x^5 + 5x^3 + 5x - 1$.

\item (10 points)
Find, with proof, a polynomial with Galois group $Sym(7)$.

\item (50 points)
(If applicable) Describe, in around two to three pages, something interesting you have learned this semester,
about number theory or a related topic, outside of this course and your other coursework.
