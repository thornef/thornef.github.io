<b>Papers in preparation,</b> with summaries (and, in some cases, with drafts):
<p>
<b>Nearly finished:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="thorne-xiong-4.pdf">Distribution of zeta zeroes for trigonal curves over a finite field</a>,
with Maosheng Xiong.
<p>
We prove two Gaussian distribution results on random trigonal curves over finite fields: for the
number of points, and for the
distribution of the zeroes of the associated zeta function lying on prescribed arcs.
<p>
The paper is essentially finished (provided we don't decide to add more results to it later), but it relies
on results of Yongqiang Zhao -- and Zhao has not finished his paper yet.
<li>
<a href="countDLgen-1p.pdf">On D_l fields of prime degree l</a>, with Henri Cohen.
<p>
We obtain explicit formulas (as a finite sum of Euler products) for the Dirichlet series enumerating
degree l fields with Galois group D_l.
<p>
We also describe a curious connection of our work to Bernoulli numbers and 
the Ankeny-Artin-Chowla conjecture. This work is closely related to <a href="ohno-nakagawa.pdf">our finished
preprint
</a> with Rubinstein-Salzedo on the Ohno-Nakagawa relation and the Scholz reflection principle; that paper
was a spinoff of this one.
<li>
<a href="montreal-book.pdf">Shintani zeta functions and analytic number theory</a>.
<p>
Expository; my contribution to the proceedings of the SMS Summer School on Counting Arithmetic Objects in Montreal
in Summer 2014, where I was an invited speaker. (<i>Formatted for inclusion into the book, scroll down a couple
of pages for the content.</i>)
</ul>
<b>At an intermediate stage:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Voronoi summation formulae related to the Shintani zeta function and applications for twisted averages</i>,
with Lillian Pierce.
<p>
The object of the paper is as in the title. We are largely finished with a Voronoi summation formula;
currently, we are working on variations and applications (in combination with exponential sum bounds,
the circle method, and/or related techniques)
<li>
<i>Weighted average of class numbers for quadratic fields</i>, with
Leo Goldmakher, Wei Ho, Kevin McGown, and Jennifer Park.
<p>
We are working on parametrization and counting theorems for one of the space
of pairs of quaternary alternating 2-forms (considered by Bhargava in Higher Composition Laws I).
<li>
<i>Secondary terms in counting functions for cubic fields, II</i>, with Manjul Bhargava and Takashi Taniguchi.
<p>
We have brought the error term in the Davenport-Heilbronn theorem (for cubic fields) down to X^(2/3), by
a synthesis of our previous methods. We are currently in the process of proving results for 3-torsion in class
groups of quadratic fields, and for relative cubic extensions of quadratic fields.
</ul>
<b>At a very early stage:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Singular exponential sums associated to prehomogeneous vector spaces over finite fields</i>, with Takashi
Taniguchi.
<p>
We investigate the Fourier transforms of the characteristic functions of certain exponential sums
associated to prehomogeneous vector spaces over finite fields (referred to as `cubic Gauss sums' in the binary
cubic case, in our previous work).

We lay out a program for evaluating these Fourier transforms, much more simply than we had done in the past.
We have computed a variety of examples and intend to tackle the case of pairs of ternary quadratic forms
(i.e., the `quartic case') soon. This should have consequences for the distribution of quartic fields and
other objects of arithmetic interest.
<li>
<i>What is the height of 2 points in the plane?</i>, with Jesse Kass.
<p>
We are currently investigating the distribution of rational points on the Hilbert scheme of two points.
