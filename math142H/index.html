<p>
<b>Welcome to Math 142!</b> Calculus is a beautiful, important, and fascinating subject.
<p>
It is also challenging. Please plan on a lot of hard work; we are here to help you succeed.
<HR>

<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Instructional Staff </b> </font>:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Instructor:</b> Frank Thorne, LeConte 400G, thorne [at] math.sc.edu.
<br>
Office Hours: Wednesdays 3:30-5:00 and Fridays 10:30-12:00.
<p>
(Note: These might occasionally be rescheduled when we have meetings.)
<p>

<p>
<li><b>Supplemental Instructor:</b> TBA.
<br>
The <i>supplemental instructor</i> is an undergraduate who has done very well in Math 142 in the past.
She will attend all the lectures and is here to help.
<br>
In place of office hours she holds <b>SI sessions</b> (see below) that you can go to.
<br>   
<i>(Note: I am not sure yet whether or not the honors section will have an SI.)</i>

<p>
<i>"Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten."</i> -- B.F. Skinner
<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul> 
<li>Have ample opportunities to practice and use <b>algebra</b>, <b>trigonometry</b>, and <b>first semester calculus</b>, increasing their skills in these areas. These topics are absolute prerequisities for Calculus II, 
but at the same time the course will be directed towards students whose background skills may
be <b>slightly</b> rusty and in need of practice.
<li>Understand <b>quantitative data</b> and its presentation. In calculus, this usually takes the shape of a 
<b>function</b>. Functions will be presented in terms of equations, or in terms of graphs,
or in English text, and students will be required to <b>seamlessly translate</b> between these.
<li>Develop the ability to explain their work clearly. As with the previous bullet point, this 
will involve a combination of equations, graphs, and English text. <b>Students are expected to learn to write well.</b>
<li>Understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to give <b>precise definitions</b>
as well as <b>informal explanations</b> and will be able to <b>explain the correspondence.</b>
<li>Tackle problems that require more than one step to solve, or whose solution is not obvious. Typically this means that you <b>try
something</b>, and <b>if it doesn't work you try something else.</b>
</ul>
The above is true of any math class. Typically, all of this is best learned in some <i>specific</i> context. Therefore,
successful students will also:
<ul>
<li>
Master techniques for evaluating integrals and determining the convergence and divergence of series.
<li>
Learn a variety of applications of integration, including areas, volumes, and arc lengths.
<li>
Further study the relationship between calculus, algebra, and geometry, through the study of parametric curves,
polar coordinates, and various area and volume problems. A key point is understanding <i>alternative ways in which
functions may be represented.</i>
</ul>
This Honors section has the additional component that you will study Thompson's <i>Calculus Made Easy</i>
and write short essays on it. By doing this, successful students will:
<ul>
<li>  
Compare and contrast two approaches to calculus. This will encourage you to think critically about each book:
what are its strengths and shortcomings? What are its goals in its presentation of calculus, and what shortcuts
is the author willing to take?
<li>
By writing short essays, develop the ability to explain mathematical topics in plain English.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning. There is a ton of homework. It will be collected and graded.</b> That is because this is the most effective way for you
to learn. But:
<ul>
<li>
The grading scale for the class is: A=90+, B=78+, C=64+, D=50+. There is extra credit on each of the
homeworks, and there will also be one extra credit question on the final exam,
so scores above 100% are possible.
<li>
All of the assignments for this course are posted below, subject to only minor changes. 
Some exam questions will come verbatim from these assignments (including the `additional problems').
So everything is predictable, and you can look before you leap.
<li>
If the numerical average on any midterm exam is at least 80%, then we will have a pizza lunch (in class) the day I hand back the exams.
</ul>
<P>
<b>This class doesn't cover exactly the same material as most sections of Math 142.</b> Compared to 
a recent version of the course:
<ul>
<li>
The treatment of <i>Calculus Made Easy</i> is unique to this section of the course.
<li>
We will de-emphasize some of the more tedious aspects of the course. For example the book treats partial
fractions as a long algorithm, broken up into many cases, and it doesn't explain why any of them actually work.
We will do fewer of the cases, and focus both on how to do them and why they work.
<li>
We will <b>add</b> the sections on <b>arc length</b> (8.1) and <b>parametric curves</b> (10.1-10.2).
The purpose is to give you a greater understanding of the flexibility of calculus and its relation to geometry, 
and to introduce you to some subjects which you are likely to encounter again later.
<li>
We will emphasize <b>explicit approximation</b> for convergence tests. We will strongly keep in mind that
''converges'' means ''equals a number''.
<li>
We will de-emphasize the problem-solving aspect of convergence tests: whenever you are asked to determine
whether or not a series converges, a suitable test will be suggested to you. Also, a list of convergence tests
will be provided for you on the exams, which means that you won't have to memorize it.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Texts </b> </font>: 
James Stewart, <i> Calculus, Early Transcendentals, </i> 6th edition. We will use a custom
edition of this book, available in the campus bookstore. However, the Calculus II portion of the book is
identical to the non-custom version. You might consider buying your book used on Amazon or elsewhere online.
You might also buy a used version from an upperclassman.
<p>
We will also read <i>Calculus Made Easy</i> by Silvanus Thompson, as revised by Martin Gardner. To my
knowledge this book is <i>not</i> available at the campus bookstore -- you can buy it
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Made-Easy-Silvanus-Thompson/dp/0312185480/">here</a> among many other
places.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Meeting schedule </b> </font>:
<ul>
<li><b>Lectures:</b> T-Th, 11:40-12:55, LeConte 121.
<li><b>Maple Lab:</b> M, 12:00-12:50, TBD.
<li><b>Discussion:</b> W, 12:00-12:50, Gambrell 104.
</ul>

<font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>: 
<ul>
<li><b>Midterm Exam 1:</b> September 25 (all midterms in class)
<li><b>Midterm Exam 2:</b> October 21
<li><b>Midterm Exam 3:</b> November 20
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> Tuesday, December 9, time TBA.
</ul>
All exams will be held in the usual classroom, during class meetings (except for the final).
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:
The homework assignments have four components:
<ul>
<li>
The <b>required</b> problems are, well, (you guys are Honors students...)
<li>
The <b>additional</b> problems are not to be turned in, but represent good practice problems, especially
for the midterm exams.
<li>
Every week one question will ask you to address some topic in Thompson's book. These should be answered
in plain English, with formulas or diagrams to match. What you read in either of your textbooks is a good
model for your answer. One handwritten page should definitely be enough. Shorter answers <i>may</i> suffice,
especially if you put some thought into your answer before you begin to write.
<li>
Each homework also includes one or more <b>bonus</b> problems. These are extra credit, and are usually very
interesting.
I encourage you to attempt them!
</ul>
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 
 
<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
The grade cutoffs are: A for 90%, B+ for 85%, B for 78%, C+ for 72%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.

<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

Late homework will generally not be accepted, except in case of illness or family emergency, or unless you clear
it with me in advance.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:

<p>

Calculators will not be allowed for the exams. 
<p>
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Here</a> is a very, very, <i>very</i> powerful calculator.
Do not use it to <i>solve</i> the homework problems, but it is a useful way to <i>check</i> your work.

<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Attendance </b> </font>:
Skipping class is unwise, but no attendance policy will be enforced. You are
responsible for all the material covered in all lectures, discussion sections, and labs.

<font size=+1> <b> Supplemental instruction </b> </font>:

<p>

<b>TBA</b> runs the supplemental instruction sessions. This is a
valuable resource and you are strongly encouraged to take advantage of it.
Please go to ask questions and meet other students. It is a particularly
good place to
work on your homework.
<p>
<i> These are held [Dates and Times TBA].</i>  

<P> 
There is also <b>free drop-in tutoring</b> available for all 100-level math courses.

<font size=+1> <b> Schedule of lectures, homeworks, and exams: </b> </font>
<p>
Homeworks are not always due on the same days of the week. This could be a bit annoying (my apologies), but it was done
to make sure no one homework is excessively long.
