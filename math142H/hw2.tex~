Read Ch. 4-5 of Thompson. Give the names (as found in Stewart) of the differentiation
rules that Thompson derives. Describe the relationship between Thompson's and Stewart's
treatments.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
What does the rule for {\itshape integration by substitution} say? Explain why this
is the Chain Rule backwards, and give a typical example of its use.

\item
What does the rule for {\itshape integration by parts} say? Explain why this is the
Product Rule backwards, and give a typical example of its use.

\item
