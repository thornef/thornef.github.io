<b>Algebraic number theory</b> is a beautiful topic. We will investigate classical
questions, such as: Which numbers can be written as a sum of two squares? How 
can we prove infinitely many cases of Fermat's Last Theorem? 
<p>
We will do this by developing a ring-theoretic approach to the subject, in terms
of (1) prime ideals, and (2) valuations. <b>There is substantial overlap with
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry</b>, and the course is strongly encouraged
for anyone interested in these subjects.

<HR>

<b>Instructor:</b> Frank Thorne, LeConte 317O, thorne [at] math [dot] sc [dot] edu
<p>
<b>Office Hours:</b> TBA
<p>
<b>Course Delivery:</b> <b>The class will be held in-person to the extent feasible, with some online classes.</b>
We will meet in person on the first day, and then move online for at least a week. In-person courses will resume
when Covid testing shows a small number of cases (similar to Fall 2020, from mid-September on).
<p>
<b>Prerequisites.</b> 701 (Algebra I) will be assumed, and students should either have taken 702 (Algebra II) or its equivalent, or be taking it concurrently.
<p>
Any background in algebraic geometry and/or commutative algebra will also be very helpful.

<p>
<b>Grading.</b> Based on homeworks. A = 75+, B = 60+, C = 40+.
Students who have passed comps already may be excused from part of the
workload (if arranged in advance) at the discretion of the instructor.
<p>
You can see the
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/thornef/math788p/midterm.pdf">midterm exam</a> I gave on April 1, 2013, when I taught
this course previously.

<h2>References.</h2>
 No books will be required, but many are recommended. Among these:
<p>
<a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~filaseta/gradcourses/TheMath784Notes.pdf">Michael Filaseta's notes</a>. Emphasizes a more elementary aspect to the subject.
<p>
<b>Rafe Jones</b>, <i>Lecture notes on algebraic number theory.</i> I took Rafe's course as a grad student, it was
damn good, and my handwriting back then was much better than it is now. With Rafe's permission, I'll scan and post
the notes I took.
<p>
<b>J.S. Milne</b>, <i>Algebraic number theory</i>, <a href=" http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/ANT.pdf">available
free online</a>.
<p>
<b>J. Neukirch</b>, <i>Algebraic number theory</i>. Obnxiously expensive, but a masterpiece of a book, for anyone who wants to learn the subject
really thoroughly (including class field theory, with complete proofs).
<p>
<b>Cassels and Frohlich</b>, <i>Algebraic number theory</i>. An advanced book, a classic, probably the best for learning 
class field theory. Contains' Tate's thesis.
<p>
<b>Murty and Esmonde</b>, <i>Problems in algebraic number theory</i>. I'll probably look here for some homework problems.
<p>
<b>Marcus</b>, <i>Number fields</i>. A popular introduction. Not TeXXed, and please don't imitate his notation
for the integers mod p, but has a very accessible introduction to Hilbert's ramification theory, and much else besides.
<p>
<b>Gouvea</b>, <i>p-adic numbers: an introduction</i>. A lively book, less than forty bucks. Consider buying it.
<p>
<b>Serre</b>, <i>A course on arithmetic</i>. Beautiful and tiny. Contains a section on the Hasse-Minkowski theorem
which I intend to cover. (You probably don't need to buy it for this course, but you could not go wrong by buying it
and reading it)
<p>
<b>Lang</b>, <i>Algebraic number theory</i>. Reading Lang is like eating broccoli. Sometimes a bit hard to get down,
but extremely good for you.
<p>
<b>Cox</b>, <i>Primes of the form x^2 + ny^2</i>. A beautiful book, covering a very interesting bit of algebraic number theory,
and also giving an excellent introduction to modular forms.
<p>
<b>Childress</b>, <i>Class field theory</i>. A more accessible introduction to class field theory than those of Neukirch
or Cassels-Frohlich. Very well written.

<h2>Topics to be covered:</h2>
<p>
Note: The list of references to be covered is not exhaustive; most of the references cover all the topics, I have tried
to pick the ones which I anticipate relying on the most.
<ul>
<li> <b>Number fields and rings of integers.</b> (4 weeks.) This will lay the foundation
for the remainder of the course. The basic object of study is a <b>number field</b>
(a finite extension of Q) together with its <b>ring of integers</b> which behaves
analogously to Z. Mostly.
<p>
References: Neukirch, Milne, Marcus.

<li> <b>The decomposition of prime ideals in extensions.</b> (4 weeks.) A classical topic in algebraic number theory, due to Hilbert,
is how prime ideals split in extensions. They can `split', be `inert', or `ramify'. We will learn what this means and see what it has
to do with classical questions. For example, a classical result (probably proved in Filaseta's course) gives a concise description of
the integers which can be written as a sum of two squares. We will see how this can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert's theory.
<p>
References: Neukirch, Milne, Marcus.

<li> <b>The p-adic numbers.</b> (4 weeks) Introduced by Kurt Hensel, 
the p-adic numbers allow us to look ``one prime at a time'' and are ubiquitous in
modern algebraic number theory. We will carefully look at their algebraic and topological properties.

Time permitting, we will also prove the <i>Hasse-Minkowski theorem</i>, the first example of a <i> local-to-global</i> principle for the solution
of Diophantine equations, which will help motivate the study of the $p$-adics.
<p>
References: Gouvea, Neukirch, Milne, Serre.



<li>
<b> Valuations and their extensions.</b> (depending on time) There is another approach to Hilbert's ramification theory, via the theory
of valuations, corresponding to extensions of the $p$-adic numbers. This is the true highbrow approach to algebraic number theory, as it 
allows us to study number fields globally by looking at their local properties. In other words, <i>think globally, act locally</i>. 
<p>
Reference: Neukirch.
<P>
To cover all this, we will unfortunately <b>not</b> be proving two of the cornerstone results of the subject -- the <b>finiteness of the class number</b> and <b>Dirichlet's unit theorem</b>. These beautiful topics require a lengthy digression into <b>the geometry of numbers</b> -- an important topic which is well worth your time to learn.
