<b>Algebraic number theory</b> is a beautiful topic. We will investigate classical
questions, such as: Which numbers can be written as a sum of two squares? How 
can we prove infinitely many cases of Fermat's Last Theorem? 

<HR>

<b>Instructor:</b> Frank Thorne, LeConte 317O, thorne [at] math [dot] sc [dot] edu
<p>
<b>Office Hours:</b> TBA
<p>
<b>Course Delivery:</b> <b>The class will be held in-person to the extent feasible, with some online classes.</b>
<p>
As of January 8, the Covid situation is exceptionally bad. Accordingly we will start the class online, with
the intent to move to in-person once things are <i>relatively</i> safe.
<p>
<b>Prerequisites.</b> 701 (Algebra I) will be assumed, and students should either have taken 702 (Algebra II) or its equivalent, or be taking it concurrently.
<p>
Any background in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, and/or other subjects within number theory will also be very helpful.
<p>
<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> Students will master the foundations of the algebraic theory of numbers.
<p>
<b>Grading.</b> Based on homeworks. A = 75+, B = 60+, C = 40+.
Students who have passed comps already may be excused from part of the
workload (if arranged in advance) at the discretion of the instructor.
<p>
You can see the
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/thornef/math788p/midterm.pdf">midterm exam</a> I gave on April 1, 2013, when I taught
this course previously.

<h2>References.</h2>
Please get Marcus's book <i>Number Fields</i> (second edition) and follow along, especially if you intend to take the qualifying exam.
Other books which are recommended include:
<p>
<a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~filaseta/gradcourses/TheMath784Notes.pdf">Michael Filaseta's notes</a>. Emphasizes a more elementary aspect to the subject.
<p>
<b>J.S. Milne</b>, <i>Algebraic number theory</i>, <a href=" http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/ANT.pdf">available
free online</a>.
<p>
<b>J. Neukirch</b>, <i>Algebraic number theory</i>. Obnxiously expensive, but a masterpiece of a book, for anyone who wants to learn the subject
really thoroughly (including class field theory, with complete proofs).
<p>
<b>Cassels and Frohlich</b>, <i>Algebraic number theory</i>. An advanced book, a classic, probably the best for learning 
class field theory. Contains' Tate's thesis.
<p>
<b>Murty and Esmonde</b>, <i>Problems in algebraic number theory</i>. 
<p>
<b>Gouvea</b>, <i>p-adic numbers: an introduction</i>. A lively book, not expensive.
<p>
<b>Serre</b>, <i>A course on arithmetic</i>. Beautiful and tiny. Contains a section on the Hasse-Minkowski theorem
which I intend to cover. (You probably don't need to buy it for this course, but you could not go wrong by buying it
and reading it)
<p>
<b>Lang</b>, <i>Algebraic number theory</i>. Reading Lang is like eating broccoli. Sometimes a bit hard to get down,
but extremely good for you.
<p>
<b>Cox</b>, <i>Primes of the form x^2 + ny^2</i>. A beautiful book, covering a very interesting bit of algebraic number theory,
and also giving an excellent introduction to modular forms.
<p>
<b>Childress</b>, <i>Class field theory</i>. A more accessible introduction to class field theory than those of Neukirch
or Cassels-Frohlich. Very well written.

<h2>Topics to be covered:</h2>
<p>
We will cover the standard foundations of the subject: number fields and rings of integers; trace, norm, and discriminant; the decomposition of prime ideals in extensions (including inertia and decomposition groups); class groups and finiteness of the class number; cyclotomic fields; introduction to valuations and completions.
<p>
If more time is available, we will cover additional topics selected from: further theory of valuations,
including extensions thereof; connections to analytic number theory (e.g. Dedekind zeta functions);
the distribution of primes and Chebotarev density; an introduction to Artin reciprocity and class field theory.
