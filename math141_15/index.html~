<b>Welcome to Math 141!</b> Calculus is a beautiful, important, challenging, and fascinating subject.

<font size=+1> <b> Instructional Staff </b> </font>:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Instructor:</b> Frank Thorne, LeConte 400G, thorne [at] math.sc.edu.
<br>
Office Hours: Monday 3:30-4:30, Tuesday 3:30-4:30, Friday 2:30-3:30.
<p>
(Note: I might have to reschedule these for meetings and such)
<p>
<li><b>Substitute Instructor:</b> Heather Smith, smithhc5 [at] email.sc.edu.
<p>Heather will sub for me when I'm away at conferences.
Office Hours: TBA (only on weeks when I'm out of town)

<p> 
<li><b>Teaching Assistant:</b> Wilson Harvey, LeConte 122B, harveywa [at] email.sc.edu
<br>
The TA will hold discussion sections and
office hours and grade the homeworks. His job is to help you get through the course.
<br>
<p>
Office Hours: Monday 11-12, Wed/Fri 10-11.
<p>
<li><b>Supplemental Instructor:</b> Stuart Sands, sandss [at] email.sc.edu.
<br>
The <i>supplemental instructor</i> is an undergraduate who has done very well in Math 141 in the past.
He will attend all the lectures and is here to help.
<br>
In place of office hours he holds <b>SI sessions</b> (see below) that you can go to.

<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul>
<li>Have ample opportunities to practice and use <b>algebra and trigonometry</b>, further increasing their skills in these areas. <b>Algebra
is an absolute prerequisite for calculus</b>, but at the same time the course will be directed towards students whose algebra skills may
be <b>slightly</b> rusty and in need of practice.
<li>Understand <b>quantitative data</b> and its presentation. In calculus, this usually takes the shape of a 
<b>function</b>. Functions will be presented in terms of equations, or in terms of graphs,
or in English text, and students will be required to <b>seamlessly translate</b> between these.
<li>Develop the ability to explain their work clearly. As with the previous bullet point, this 
will involve a combination of equations, graphs, and English text. <b>Students are expected to learn to write well.</b>
<li>Understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to give <b>precise definitions</b>
as well as <b>informal explanations</b> and will be able to <b>explain the correspondence.</b>
<li>Tackle problems that require more than one step to solve, or whose solution is not obvious. Typically this means that you <b>try
something</b>, and <b>if it doesn't work you try something else.</b>
</ul>
This could describe any math class. Typically, all of this is best learned in some <i>specific</i> context. Therefore,
successful students will also:
<ul>
<li>
Master concepts and problems involving limits, derivatives, integrals, and applications of all of the above.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning. There is a ton of homework. It will be collected and graded.</b> That is because this is the most effective way for you
to learn. But:
<ul>
<li>
This class has
a 12-point curve (i.e. A=88, B=76, etc.) as opposed to the usual ten point curve. My standards are high and so I think it is fair
that you should have more wiggle room. 
<li>
All of the assignments for this course, including a complete list of questions that may
show up on the exams, are posted below. So <b>everything is completely predictable</b>, and you can look before you leap.
<li>
<b>My goal is that you will earn the highest grades of any 141 class.</b> To that end, I've made my expectations
very clear -- the standards are high, but you can meet them and it is my job to help you.
<li>
If the numerical average on any midterm exam is at least 76%, then we will have a pizza lunch (in class) the day I hand back the exams.
</ul>

<font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
James Stewart, <i> Calculus, Early Transcendentals, </i> 6th edition. We will use a custom
edition of this book, available in the campus bookstore. It has not changed since last year, so please feel
free to buy a used version from an upperclassman.
<p>
I also highly recommend

Calculus Made Easy</a> by Silvanus Thompson.
If nothing else, read the epilogue on p. 283.

<font size=+1> <b> Meeting schedule </b> </font>:
<ul>
<li><b>Lectures:</b> MWF, 12:20-1:10, LC 113.
<li><b>Maple Lab:</b> (TBD)
<li><b>Recitation:</b> (TBD)
</ul>

<font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>: 
<ul>
<li><b>Precalculus Exam</b> (half exam, really more of a long quiz), Monday, September 3. Will be dropped from your final average if this improves your grade.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 1:</b> Wednesday, September 26.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 2:</b> Wednesday, October 31.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 3:</b> Wednesday, November 30.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> Thursday, December 13, 12:30 p.m.
</ul>
All exams will be held in the usual classroom (LC 113), during class meetings (except for the final).
<p>
The <b>midterm exams</b> will be very similar to the homeworks, and several problems will be taken exactly
from the homework assignments. There will not be any topics on the exams that were not covered in the
homeworks.
<p>
The <b>final exam will be taken exactly from the homeworks</b>. <a href="final-exam.pdf">See here</a>.

<font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:

Homework is due to your TA by 5:00 p.m., on Fridays except as otherwise noted below. (Your TA will tell you where to turn in your homework.)
The homework <b>will be graded and returned to you,</b> according to the following scheme. Each homework is
worth 10 points. Out of that, three problems will be selected each week (randomly, for the most part) and graded
carefully, and each is worth 2 points. The remaining 4 points are for overall quality and completion.
<p>
<b>All the homework assignments</b> can be downloaded from this website (see below).
<b>They are long.</b> Do not start the night before.<b>They are also very important.</b>
<p>
Each homework will have ''required'', ''additional'', and (one or more) ''bonus'' problems. 
The additional problems are not required; if you do them then the points taken off elsewhere will be reduced by up to 50%.
The bonus problems are extra credit.
<p>
All exam problems will be taken verbatim from the homework assignments.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
The grade cutoffs are: A for 88%, B+ for 84%, B for 76%, C+ for 72%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.

<p>
Only <b>your highest two</b> midterm exam grades will be counted. Also, the above does not include the precalculus
exam the week of September 3. This exam will be counted 10% or 0% of your total, whichever makes your grade turn out higher.

<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

Late homework will generally not be accepted, but please ask your TA if you have special circumstances.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:

<p>

Calculators will not be allowed for the exams. You may use them on the homework if you want, but this is discouraged,
as the purpose of the homework is to prepare you for the exams.

<font size=+1> <b> Supplemental instruction </b> </font>:

<p>

<b>Stuart Sands</b> runs the supplemental instruction sessions. This is a
valuable resource and you are strongly encouraged to take advantage of it.
Please go to ask questions and meet other students. It is a particularly
good place to
