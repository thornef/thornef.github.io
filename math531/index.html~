<li> <FONT SIZE =+1> <B> Learning outcomes: </B> </Font>

<p>

<b>Successful students will </b> master a variety of concepts in Euclidean geometry. In particular:
<ul>
<li>Students will prove theorems about lines, circles, triangles, and other geometric shapes, and learn material
substantially beyond what is taught in high school.

<li>Students will learn some of the axiomatic approach, which builds geometry from absolute scratch and does not rely
on ``intuition''. To this end, students will read selections from the most well-known classic in all of mathematics:
Euclid's <i>Elements</i>.

<li>Students will learn the <b>constructive</b> approach. Students will learn to construct geometric figures using
ruler and straightedge and to explain their constructions to others.
</ul>
In addition, students will also:
<ul>
<li>Thoroughly understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to precisely state definitions
and theorems and understand how they are applied.
<li>Practice writing <b>proofs.</b> It is expected that the student will have some, but not a lot, of experience writing proofs.
The student will gain more practice.
<li>Practice drawing <b>good pictures</b>. Diagrams are a very important part of the presentation of quantitative information,
and geometry gives us an excellent opportunity to practice. It is expected that your pictures will be <b>not only correct</b>,
but also <b>clear</b> and <b>as simple as possible</b>.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning.</b> You should expect 5-8 hours of homework a week in this class, which is more than most other instructors assign; 
in my experience there is no other way to learn the material. Your consistent effort will certainly lead to improved understanding,
and it will almost certainly lead to you earning high grades.
<P>

</ul>
We will read selections from four textbooks. The Isaacs book is required; please plan on reading parts of
it closely. We will only read a little bit from Stillwell -- skimp on this if you must -- but he is very
good at making complicated ideas easy.

The books are each approximately $40 on Amazon. The bookstore charges <b>much</b> more so I recommend
you order the books online.

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Lectures </b> </font>:
LeConte 303B, MWF, 9:05-9:55. Too early if you ask me. Bring coffee; I certainly will.

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>:
In-class midterms on Wednesday, September 28 and Wednesday, October 31. The final exam 
will be given on Saturday, December 15 at 9:00 a.m. (I did not pick the time...)

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:
<p>
<b> Warning. I assign a lot of homework.</b>
<p>
The homework is intended to take 5-8 hours a week. That is a lot. Please
count on making a consistent effort to do well in this class! Starting the night before is a bad idea.
<p>
If homework takes you more than 10 hours on any given week, then that is more than I intended;
please let me know.
<p>
There will be at least one <b>bonus</b> problem on each homework, each worth one or two points, up to a maximum
score of 11/10 on each week's homework. This is the only way to earn extra credit; please note that bonus problems
will not be accepted late.
<p>
<b>Graduate credit:</b> If you want graduate credit, you are required to do at least one bonus problem from
every other homework (i.e., do one from HW1 or HW2, etc.) Bonus problems on top of that count for extra credit.
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
<b>Please note</b>. You will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. Indeed, a major
focus of Math 531 is the ability to communicate mathematical ideas clearly.
<b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
In particular, please write in <b>complete English sentences</b> and draw <b>clear diagrams</b> where appropriate.

Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.
<p>
<b>Grading scale</b>: A = 90+, B+ = 85+, B = 78+, C+ = 73+, C = 66+, D = 52+. 
<p>
<b>Please note that my grading scale is more generous than the usual 10-point scale.</b> However,
I am a (slightly) stricter grader than most.
This is intended
to balance out.

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Contacting me </b> </font>:

<b>Please contact me if you have any questions about the course, about my expectations, about my lectures,
about the homeworks, about the reading, or about anything else</b>. The syllabus is demanding and it is my
job to help you succeed.

The best ways to get help are to come to office hours (no appointment necessary) or to e-mail me (I will
almost always reply within 24 hours). If neither of these work for you then please e-mail me to set up an
appointment.
<p>

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise makeup exams will be given only in case of documented emergency.
<p>
Late homework will be accepted <b>once per student</b>, up to a week late; after that, no late homework please
except in case of emergency.
<p>
<b>Academic honesty</b> and <b>attendance</b> are expected of all students.
<P>

<b>Calculators</b> will not be needed or allowed. You will eventually require a 
<b>compass and straightedge</b>, including on exams.

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b>Rough outline</b> </font> (times are <b>very</b> approximate)
<ul>
<li> <b>The Building Blocks of Geometry</b> (4 weeks): We will investigate basic properties
of lines, triangles, circles, angles, and other basic geometric shapes. This will
likely review what you already know, but at a more advanced level and with proofs.
We will cover
all of Ch. 1 of Isaacs and borrow from Stillwell as appropriate.
<p>
<li> <b>The Foundations of Geometry</b> (4 weeks): Having seen the modern approach, we will then
investigate the axiomatic foundations of the subject. This will take us all the way to the beginning,
to Euclid. We will also read Hilbert's
1899 <i>Foundations of Geometry</i>, and see what Euclid left out.
<p>
<li> <b>The Constructive Approach</b> (2 weeks): This was Euclid's approach: what good are 
geometric shapes if we cannot build them? We will bust out the toys and construct
geometric objects using compass and straightedge. 
<p>
<li> <b>Advanced Topics in Geometry</b> (5 weeks): Finally, we will return to Isaacs' book and
cover as much as we have time for. We will prove fascinating theorems about triangles,
circles, and lines that you likely haven't seen before. Probably we will concentrate
on Sections 2 and 3.

</ul>
