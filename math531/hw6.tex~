Perform the following constructions with compass and straightedge. Explain your steps.
Briefly explain why your constructions work when not clear (this is a judgement call),
but full proofs are not required.

There are a lot of questions, but they are pretty easy and we did most of them in class.
\\
\\
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
Bisect an angle.
\item
Bisect a given line segment.
\item
Construct an equilateral triangle.
\item
Construct a square.
\item
Construct a regular hexagon.
\item
Draw an arbitrary triangle; then, construct a copy of it.
\item
Draw a segment of a circle; then, find its center.
\item
Given a segment of length $1$, construct segments of length $\sqrt{2} + 1$, $\sqrt{2} - 1$, $5 \sqrt{2}$, 
and $\frac{1}{3}$.
\item
Construct angles of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 degrees.
\item
The {\itshape golden ratio} is $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. It is often thought that rectangles whose sides
are in this proportion are especially pleasing to the eye.

Construct such a rectangle, and judge for yourself.
\item (Bonus.)
Construct a regular $17$-gon. Feel free to search the internet, but please explain the construction in
your own words.

\end{enumerate}
