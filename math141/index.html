<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul>
<li>Have ample opportunities to practice and use <b>algebra and trigonometry</b>, further increasing their skills in these areas. <b>Algebra
is an absolute prerequisite for calculus</b>, but at the same time the course will be directed towards students whose algebra skills may
be <b>slightly</b> rusty and in need of practice. 
<li>Understand <b>quantitative data</b> and its presentation. In calculus, this usually takes the shape of a 
<b>function</b>. Functions will be presented in terms of equations, or in terms of graphs,
or in English text, and students will be required to <b>seamlessly translate</b> between these.
<li>Develop the ability to explain their work clearly. As with the previous bullet point, this 
will involve a combination of equations, graphs, and English text. <b>Students are expected to learn to write well.</b>
<li>Understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to give <b>precise definitions</b>
as well as <b>informal explanations</b> and will be able to <b>explain the correspondence.</b>
<li>Tackle problems that require more than one step to solve, or whose solution is not obvious. Typically this means that you <b>try
something</b>, and <b>if it doesn't work you try something else.</b>
</ul>
This could describe any math class. Typically, all of this is best learned in some <i>specific</i> context. Therefore,
successful students will also:
<ul>
<li>
Master concepts and problems involving limits, derivatives, integrals, and applications of all of the above.
</ul>

<font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
Thomas, <i> Calculus, Early Transcendentals, </i> 15th edition. 
The book is available for $173.32 from the campus bookstore, and moreover that doesn't buy you a physical book, only an e-book. Blergh.

<p>
I hope to move the department towards adopting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">OER</a>
as soon as a group effort can be organized, but for now we're still using Thomas.

The book is bundled with access to MyMathLab, which we will use for the homework assignments. 
The book comes in two versions, one for $173.32 and $199.99 -- the cheaper version comes with 18 weeks of MyMathLab access,
and the more expensive version covers (I think) two years. Please get the more expensive version if you intend to take Math 142.

<p>
I also highly recommend
<a href="https://calculusmadeeasy.org">
Calculus Made Easy</a> by Silvanus Thompson.
If nothing else, read the <a href="https://calculusmadeeasy.org/epilogue.html">epilogue</a>.

<font size=+2> <b> Exams, Homework, and Gateways:</b> </font>

<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font> (all in LC 444): 
<ul>
<li><b>Midterm Exam 1:</b> Wednesday, September 27 in class.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 2:</b> Monday, October 30 in class.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 3:</b> Friday, December 1 in class.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> Wednesday, December 13, 9:00-11:30 a.m.
</ul>
<p>
<b>All questions on all exams will be taken verbatim from the "practice problems" listed below.</b>
<p>
In addition, <b>four practice final exams</b> will be posted near the end of the semester, and you can do them for
extra credit. I will write five versions of the exam, and choose the actual exam randomly from these -- the
other four are your practice. 

<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:

Homework will be assigned via MyMathLab. The course ID is <b>thorne70879</b>. To sign up:

<ul>
<li>
Go to <a href="https://mlm.pearson.com/enrollment/thorne70879">https://mlm.pearson.com/enrollment/thorne70879</a>, and either sign in or create an account.
<li>Enter the prepaid access code that came with your textbook.
<li>Select Go to my course, and Math 141 -- Calculus I from My Courses.
</ul>


<p>
<b>Advice and Guidelines:</b> 
<ul>
<li><b>The homework assignments are long. Do not start the night before.</b>
<li><b>Work with pencil and paper,</b> at least for the harder problems. 
<li><b>Do not use Sage, Maple, Wolfram Alpha, ChatGPT, etc.</b> Doing so is an academic integrity violation.
<li><b>Working with others is encouraged, but copying others' solutions is an academic integrity violation.</b>
</ul>
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Practice Problems </b> </font>:
In addition to the homeworks, <b>practice problems</b> will be posted to the course website regularly. These aren't required, but 
<b>all quiz and exam problems will be taken verbatim from the Practice Problems.</b> So make sure you know how to solve them! This includes the
"theory/explain" problems -- if a question asks you to explain why the definition
of a derivative is the way it is, be prepared to see that question on an exam.
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Gateway Exams </b> </font>: You will also take two <b>gateway exams</b> with your TA. These are designed
to test your readiness and ensure that everyone in the course is on track. 
<b>By department policy, for each gateway exam not passed your grade will be lowered by one letter grade.</b> For the first gateway,
this penalty will be waived if you complete Math 151, a corequisite course designed to give extra help to students with gaps in
their background. If you enroll after August 30, you can still enroll through September 8 by filling out a
<a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/documents/registration-exception-form.pdf">Registration Exception Form</a>
and filing it with the University Registrar.
<p>
The gateways are closely integrated into Blackboard, <b>so please see Blackboard for detailed instructions</b>. (On the left, click on "Course Content/Modules".)

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+2> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
The grade cutoffs are: A for 88%, B+ for 84%, B for 76%, C+ for 72%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.  <b>Note: these are more generous than the usual 10-point cutoffs!!</b>
This is intended to compensate for somewhat stricter grading.

<p>
<font size=+2> <b> Class Policies: </b> </font>
<p>


<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>: If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

Late homework will generally not be accepted, but please ask your TA if you have special circumstances.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Disability accommodations </b> </font>: If you have a disability which requires any sort of accommodation please contact
<a href="https://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/">Student Disability Services</a>. I am very happy to follow their
recommendations, and to schedule alternate exams if need be, provided that you provide notice at least
one week in advance.
<p>

<b> Calculators </b> will not be allowed for the quizzes or exams. You may use them on the homework if you want, but this is discouraged,
as the purpose of the homework is to prepare you for the exams.

<p>
<b> Attendance </b> is expected of all students, but no penalty will be enforced for absences.

<p>
<b> Academic integrity</b> is required of all students.

<p> <b>If you have difficulty seeing the board or hearing the lectures, or a related problem, let me know ASAP</b>, and I will do something about it. It is very important to me that everyone has the opportunity to succeed.

<P> Most importantly, <b>it is my goal to create a welcoming classroom environment</b>, 
free of racism, sexism, homo- or transphobia, discrimination, bullying, insults, or harassment. Please bring any concerns to me; major or repeated violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.

university courses, on which you can ask and answer questions, develop study tools, and more.
<p>
Here is their syllabus statement:
<p>
<i>
Students in this class will use the <a href="http://CircleInApp.app.link">CircleIn</a> 
app and web-platform to study and to help one another succeed in this course. Studying and learning alone is one of the hardest parts of a course. With CircleIn, you can build better study habits, improve your learning, expand your network of other students you know and earn mirco-rewards by engaging in discussions with classmates. 

<p>
You can also ask "anonymous questions" to your classmates, so you don't have to worry about being embarrassed of asking any question. For those of you needing help, use it to ask questions, and for those of you willing to help others, please check it often to look for questions that haven't been responded to yet.  
<p>

This is your community, so please login regularly to support each other and solve problems as they arise. Think of CircleIn as a study community where each of you are stronger together and if you like the convenience of connecting with classmates outside of class, please use it. 
<p>

CircleIn is paid for by the University of South Carolina for your benefit, so please take advantage of it today. CircleIn has no ads and you never have to share your personal information.
