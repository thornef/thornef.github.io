<FONT SIZE =+1> <B> Learning outcomes: </B> </Font>

<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul>
<li>Have ample opportunities to practice and use <b>algebra and trigonometry</b>, further increasing their skills in these areas. <b>Algebra
is an absolute prerequisite for calculus</b>, but at the same time the course will be directed towards students whose algebra skills may
be <b>slightly</b> rusty and in need of practice.
<li>Understand <b>quantitative data</b> and its presentation. In calculus, this usually takes the shape of a 
<b>function</b>. Functions will be presented in terms of equations, or in terms of graphs,
or in English text, and students will be required to <b>seamlessly translate</b> between these.
<li>Develop the ability to explain their work clearly. As with the previous bullet point, this 
will involve a combination of equations, graphs, and English text. <b>Students are expected to learn to write well.</b>
<li>Understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to give <b>precise definitions</b>
as well as <b>informal explanations</b> and will be able to <b>explain the correspondence.</b>
<li>Tackle problems that require more than one step to solve, or whose solution is not obvious. Typically this means that you <b>try
something</b>, and <b>if it doesn't work you try something else.</b>
</ul>
This could describe any math class. Typically, all of this is best learned in some <i>specific</i> context. Therefore,
successful students will also:
<ul>
<li>
Master concepts and problems involving limits, derivatives, integrals, and applications of all of the above.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning. There is a ton of homework. It will be collected and graded.</b> That is because this is the most effective way for you
to learn. But:
<ul>
<li>
This class has
a 12-point curve (i.e. A=88, B=76, etc.) as opposed to the usual ten point curve. My standards are high and so I think it is fair
that you should have more wiggle room. 
<li>
All of the assignments for this course, including a complete list of questions that may
show up on the exams, are posted below. So <b>everything is completely predictable</b>, and you can look before you leap.
<li>
<b>My goal is that you will earn the highest grades of any 141 class.</b> To that end, I've made my expectations
very clear -- the standards are high, but you can meet them and it is my job to help you.
</ul>
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
Thomas, <i> Calculus, Early Transcendentals, </i> 15th edition. 
The book is available for $141.15 from the campus bookstore; although high, this price represents a substantial
discount which our department negotiated with the publisher. The book is bundled with access to MyMathLab, which
will not be used in this section of 141. The same book will also be (presumably) used
for 142 and 241.

This is the same as the book used last year. Also, although the bookstore's books have
a special cover, my understanding is that the book is identical to "non-custom editions"
available elsewhere. So you are also welcome to obtain the book elsewhere if you can find it.

<p>
I also highly recommend
<a href="http://djm.cc/library/Calculus_Made_Easy_Thompson.pdf">
Calculus Made Easy</a> by Silvanus Thompson.
If nothing else, read the epilogue on p. 283.

<font size=+1> <b> Meeting schedule </b> </font>:
<ul>
<li><b>Lectures:</b> MWF, 10:50-11:40, LC 444.
<li><b>Lab and Recitation:</b> TR, 8:30-9:20 (Sections 9-10) or 10:05-10:55 (Sections 11-12), LeConte 123.
</ul>

<font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>: 
<ul>
<li><b>Midterm Exam 1:</b> xxx in class.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 2:</b> xxx in class.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 3:</b> xxx in class.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> Wednesday, December 13, 9:00-11:30 a.m.
</ul>
All exams will be held in the usual classroom (LC 444).
<p>
<b>All questions on all exams will be taken verbatim from the "practice problems" listed below.</b>
<p>
In addition, <b>four practice final exams</b> will be posted near the end of the semester, and you can do them for
extra credit. I will write five versions of the exam, and choose the actual exam randomly from these -- the
other four are your practice. 

<font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:

Homework is due to your TA by 5:00 p.m., on Fridays except as otherwise noted below. (Your TA will tell you where to turn in your homework.)
The homework <b>will be graded and returned to you,</b> according to the following scheme. Each homework is
worth 10 points. Out of that, three problems will be selected each week (randomly, for the most part) and graded
carefully, and each is worth 2 points. The remaining 4 points are for overall quality and completion.
<p>
<b>All the homework assignments</b> can be downloaded from this website (see below).
<b>They are long.</b> Do not start the night before.<b>They are also very important.</b>
<p>
Each homework will have ''required'' and ''additional'' problems. The additional problems are
not required; it is recommended that you check that you know how to do them, and they might appear on exams.
<p>
<b>All exam problems will be taken verbatim from the homework assignments.</b>
<P>


<font size=+1> <b> Gateway Exams </b> </font>: You will also take two <b>gateway exams</b> with your TA. These are designed
to test your readiness and ensure that everyone in the course is on track. 

There are two gateway exams: the first on precalculus, and the second on limits and differential calculus. You are allowed
two attempts on the first exam, and three on the second. Proctored attempts can be made during designated lab sections, 
in office hours with your TA, or the Mathematics Tutoring Center on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
You can also take unlimited <b>practice</b> gateway exams before taking the actual exams.

<b>By department policy, for each gateway exam not passed your grade will be lowered by one letter grade.</b> For the first
gateway exam, this penalty will be waived if you then enroll in Math 151 -- a course designed to be taken at the same time
as Math 141, and which provides extra help for people with gaps in their background.

---TBA---

<font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
The grade cutoffs are: A for 88%, B+ for 84%, B for 76%, C+ for 72%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.

<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

Late homework will generally not be accepted, but please ask your TA if you have special circumstances.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Disability accommodations </b> </font>:

<p> 

If you have a disability which requires any sort of accommodation please contact
<a href="https://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/">Student Disability Services</a>. I am very happy to follow their
recommendations, and to schedule alternate exams if need be, provided that you provide notice at least
one week in advance.
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:

<p>

Calculators will not be allowed for the exams. You may use them on the homework if you want, but this is discouraged,
as the purpose of the homework is to prepare you for the exams.

<font size=+2> <b> CircleIn: </b> </font>

<p>

This course will participate in a trial of software called <a href="https://www.circleinapp.com/">CircleIn</a>. CircleIn is a social networking app designed for
university courses, on which you can ask and answer questions, develop study tools, and more.
<p>
Here is their syllabus statement:
<p>
<i>
Students in this class will use the <a href="http://CircleInApp.app.link">CircleIn</a> 
app and web-platform to study and to help one another succeed in this course. Studying and learning alone is one of the hardest parts of a course. With CircleIn, you can build better study habits, improve your learning, expand your network of other students you know and earn mirco-rewards by engaging in discussions with classmates. 

<p>
You can also ask "anonymous questions" to your classmates, so you don't have to worry about being embarrassed of asking any question. For those of you needing help, use it to ask questions, and for those of you willing to help others, please check it often to look for questions that haven't been responded to yet.  
<p>

This is your community, so please login regularly to support each other and solve problems as they arise. Think of CircleIn as a study community where each of you are stronger together and if you like the convenience of connecting with classmates outside of class, please use it. 
<p>

CircleIn is paid for by the University of South Carolina for your benefit, so please take advantage of it today. CircleIn has no ads and you never have to share your personal information.
