<b>Welcome to Math 374!</b> Discrete Mathematics is a beautiful, important, and fascinating subject. This course is designed to
give you a broad background in topics such as propositional logic, proof by induction, elementary combinatorics, and
asymptotic analysis. The course is designed to be especially useful for students majoring in computer science and related topics.
<p>
It is also challenging. Please plan on a lot of hard work; I am here to help you succeed.

<b> Instructor </b>: Frank Thorne, LeConte 317O, thorne [at] math.sc.edu.

Office Hours: To be determined.

<i>"Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten."</i> -- B.F. Skinner
<p>
Successful students will learn the basics of a variety of topics within discrete mathematics (please see the schedule below for
a complete list), with an eye towards their applications in computer science. The course will involve and further develop some
proof-writing ability, but this will not be the principal focus of this course.

<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Text: </b> </font> The course will be taught out of Judith
Gersting, <i>Mathematical Structures for Computer Science</i>, <b>sixth</b> edition.
This is <b>not</b> the most recent edition. As of this writing, inexpensive used copies
could be bought at
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Structures-Computer-Science-Gersting/dp/071676864X/">Amazon</a>,
<a href="https://www.abebooks.com/9780716768647/Mathematical-Structures-Computer-Science-Judith-071676864X/plp">AbeBooks</a>,
<a href="http://product.half.ebay.com/Mathematical-Structures-for-Computer-Science-by-Judith-L-Gersting-2006-Hardcover-Revised/52616274&tg=info">half.com</a>, and elsewhere. The book is also available at the campus bookstore, albeit at an 
astronomical price.

Additional course materials may be chosen from free online sources including the following:
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Mathematics for Computer Science</i>, by Lehman, Leigton,
and Meyer. 
<a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf">
Download</a>.
<li>
<i>Mathematical Reasoning and Proof</i>, by Sundstrom.
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mathematicalreasoning3ed/">
Book homepage</a> (with download links).
<p>
<li><i>A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics</i>, by Fields.
<a href="http://giam.southernct.edu/GIAM/">Book homepage</a>,
with download links (and even <a href="https://github.com/osj1961/giam">source code</a>!)
</ul>
<p>
Another good commercially available book is
Epp's <i>Discrete Mathematics with Applications</i>; this has a reputation for being gentler than Gersting.
Once again, look for used copies of previous editions on the internet.

<font size=+1> <b> Meeting schedule </b> </font>: MWF, 9:40-10:30 am, Gambrell 201.
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>: 
<ul>
<li><b>Midterm Exam 1:</b> October 4.
<li><b>Midterm Exam 2:</b> November 8.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> Wednesday, December 13 at 9:00 a.m.
</ul>
All exams will be held in the usual classroom, and the midterms will be held during class meetings.

<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Homework and Quizzes </b> </font>: 
<p>
Homework will generally be due on Fridays, and there will be a quiz
on the same material on the homework due dates. Homework assignments consist of three components. Problems labeled
<b>do</b> are to be turned in. Problems labeled <b>understand</b> are problems you should know how to do -- most of the
quiz and exam questions will be very similar to these problems (and often will be taken from these problems directly). 
<b>Extra credit</b> problems will reward anyone seeking out an additional challenge.  

<p>
Late homework will not be accepted, and (except in case of a documented university conflict) makeup quizzes will not be given.
Instead, your lowest two quiz scores and homework scores will be dropped. 
<p>
<b>Extra reward for perfect quizzes</b>: If you earn a perfect score on a quiz, you'll automatically get a perfect score on that week's 
homework too.
<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 
 
<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
You are guaranteed at least the following grades: A for 90%, B+ for 85%, B for 78%, C+ for 72%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.

You may wish to see the <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/thornef/math374_15/">course website</a> for the
previous time I taught this course, complete with old quizzes and exams (with solutions). This year's course
might not cover exactly the same topics, but it will not be too far away.
<p>
You can also see <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/lu/math374/">Linyuan Lu's course website</a>; he is also
teaching Math 374 this term.

<p>

<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:
If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

<p>
<font size=+1> <b>Disability accommodations </b> </font>:
If you require special accommodations due to a disability, please see the
<a href="http://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/">
Student Disability Resource Center</a>; they will make recommendations to me and I will follow them. 
It is your responsibility to inform me of needed accommodations at least a week in advance.

<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:
Calculators will not be needed or allowed for the exams or quizzes.
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Attendance </b> </font>:
Skipping class is unwise, but no attendance policy will be enforced. You are
responsible for all the material covered in all lectures and homework problems, and you must
be present in class for a quiz to take it.
