<h2>What is arithmetic geometry?</h2>
Arithmetic (or <i>diophantine</i>) geometry is, equivalently:
<ul>
<li>The study of solutions to polynomial equations, especially over the integers and 
over the rationals. For example a classical problem is to prove that the equation a^n + b^n = c^n has no nontrivial integer solutions when n is at least 3. This is known as "Fermat's Last Theorem" but its proof had to wait much later, for Andrew Wiles.
<li>Algebraic geometry over fields which are not algebraically closed. (Fermat's Last Theorem is much less interesting over C than it is over Z or Q.)
</ul>
<h2>Course objectives and learning outcomes:</h2>

<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul>
<li>Master a variety of techniques for finding rational and integral points on varieties when they do exist, and proving nonexistence when they don't. Students will, at least, be able to describe the set of rational points on conics and on elliptic curves.
<li>Master the basics of elliptic curves: what are they, what is the group law, how do you find the rational points, and what is the structure of the group of rational points. Be able to describe characteristics of elliptic curves over Q, over C, and over finite fields.
<li>Witness (and, if they put in significant additional effort, master) classical proofs in the subject, in particular that of the Mordell-Weil theorem.
<li>Understand the statement of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, one of the seven Millenium Problems (and one of the six unsolved Millenium Problems!), worth a bounty of $1,000,000.
<li>Study the relevance of algebraic geometry for problems in number theory. Students who have studied algebraic geometry will learn how these techniques are applied by number theorists. Students who have not will see its beauty and power, and will hopefully be motivated to study algebraic geometry.
<li>Gain exposure to a wide variety of problems in arithmetic geometry, as well as the wide variety of mathematical tools (representation theory, harmonic and complex analysis, algebraic number theory, commutative algebra, scheme theory, modular forms, etc., etc., etc.) which go into its study. There is far too much material to master in a lifetime, let alone in a semester. The student will gain an appreciation for the subject in broad outline, sufficient to better understand conference talks and some of the research literature, and opening doors to the study of further special topics. 
</ul>

<p>
<b>Extraordinarily successful students will:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Prove the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Be sure to say I was your thesis
advisor.
</ul>

<h2>Course prerequisites:</h2>

<p>
<b>Hard prerequisites:</b> Abstract algebra (701/702 or equivalent; concurrent enrollment okay), and elementary number theory (780 or equivalent, or willingness to learn this material on the side).
<p>
<b>Soft prerequisites:</b> Occasionally other mathematical disciplines will be brought in, especially algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. The student who has studied these topics before will get the most out of the course.
<p>
Many students will not have had these prerequisites. Occasionally the course will go over their heads (I hope not too badly!) but that is par for a topics graduate course in any case. Such students will be okay -- it is hoped that the course will motivate them to learn a little bit on the side and to study these topics in depth later.
 
<h2>Course Textbooks:</h2>

Large portions of the course will simultaneously follow <i>two</i> books on elliptic
curves. These are:

<ul>
<li>Silverman and Tate, <i>Rational Points on Elliptic Curves</i>.
This elementary book was written for advanced undergraduates. It is suitable for
beginners, first-year students, or anyone whose thesis will not involve a heavy
amount of algebraic machinery.
<p>
<li>Silverman, <i>The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves</i>. This is <i>the</i>
book on elliptic curves. Silverman works hard to be 'accessible' and 'friendly',
while introducing the student to the highbrow perspective. In particular, Silverman
illustrates the relevance of ideas from algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory,
group cohomology, complex analysis, and a host of other algebraic topics. 
<p>
Students wishing to master these topics, wanting to work in algebraic geometry, or
whose theses will involve a heavy algebraic component
should invest the time to closely study
Silverman's book.
</ul>
The student should purchase and follow along in one (or both) of these books,
according to his or her background and aims.

<h2>Required Work:</h2> 

There are two components to your grade. Each counts for half, and for the first there are three options:
<h3>Written Work:</h3>
<ul>
<li>(Option 1) A large number of homework exercises will be posted throughout the term which will be largely computational in nature. Many will be taken from Silverman-Tate;
this option is well suited to beginners, or to students not aiming to learn any
algebraic geometry.
<li>(Option 2) At least ten homework problems 
will be posted throughout the term, many with multiple parts. The student is required to finish at least eight. Some will
come from Silverman's book. These will be more difficult, and may require algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, analysis, or other subjects. I will be happy to provide hints and suggested reading material for students who want to fill in their background.

<li>(Option 3. For students admitted to Ph.D. candidacy only) The student may confer with the instructor and/or his/her thesis advisor to find a special topic of interest, which is related to arithmetic geometry and to the student's research interests. The student should write a 5-10 page expository paper and give an hour-long lecture in a suitable venue such as the <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/filaseta/numthryseminars.html">Number Theory Seminar</a> or <b>Student Algebra Seminar</b>.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Seminar Participation and Reports:</h3>
<p>
The student should regularly attend one or more of the following seminars:
the 
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/ballard/seminars/algebra/current/">Algebraic Geometry,
Arithmetic Geometry, and Commutative Algebra Seminar</a>, the
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/filaseta/numthryseminars.html">Number Theory
Seminar</a>, and the <a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/colloquia">Department Colloquium</a>.
<p>
Students should write reports on each of at least six talks. (These talks should
be given by six different speakers, and USC students or faculty don't count.) Reports should be at least one typeset page, and might discuss the speaker's main results, background material which the speaker presented, and questions you have. In writing your reports, you are encouraged to supplement your lecture attendance by reading outside material.
<p>
I'll provide a LaTeX template to make the typesetting especially easy, and to set a good example I'll do it with you! 
<p>
This is great practice for mathematicians at any career stage. If you don't believe me, then you should believe <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/threethings.html">Ravi Vakil</a>, <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~dzb/adviceArithmeticGeometry.html">David Zureick-Brown</a>, <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~poonen/advice.html">Bjorn Poonen</a>, etc.
<p>
If you attend any conferences related to arithmetic geometry, you are also welcome to report on talks given there. 
<a href="http://scripts.mit.edu/~kedlaya/wiki/index.php?title=Conferences_in_Arithmetic_Geometry">Here</a> is an incomplete lists of some
conferences worth attending. I recommend especially the <a href="http://swc.math.arizona.edu">Arizona Winter School</a>, which is intended specifically for graduate students. (But that won't stop me from showing up myself.)
</ul>

<h3>Grading Scheme:</h3> 
Students are guaranteed an A for 80%, B for 60%, C for 40%, D for 20%.
<p>

<h2>Other References</h2>
<p>
<h3>Arithmetic Geometry:</h3>
<p>
A third great book on elliptic curves is <b>Knapp</b>, <i>Elliptic curves</i>. This covers similar material, only at a gentler, less technical pace. You might also see
<b>McKean and Moll</b> for an interesting approach emphasizing topology. Another
good book is <b>Koblitz</b>'s <i>Introduction to elliptic curves and modular forms</i>.
It has the friendliest introduction to modular forms of half-integral weight
of which I am aware.
<p>
A wonderful advanced book is <b>Hindry and Silverman</b>'s <i>Diophantine Geometry</i>. (But Do Not Read Part A.) Their book is very much not limited to elliptic curves. There are also a wealth of outstanding,
still more advanced books. See <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~dzb/adviceArithmeticGeometry.html">
David Zureick-Brown's page</a> for advice and further links.
<p>
There is also <b>Sutherland</b>'s lecture notes, available free 
<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-782-introduction-to-arithmetic-geometry-fall-2013/lecture-notes/">here</a> from MIT OpenCourseWare.
<p>
<h3>Algebra:</h3>
<p>
A generally useful book is <b>Dummit and Foote</b>'s <i>Abstract Algebra</i>. It
has excellent brief introductions to subjects such as representation theory, Galois cohomology, etc. which will mostly suffice for this course. <b>Lang</b>'s <i>Algebra</i>
is also excellent, especially if you are <i>not</i> an absolute beginner.

If you are using Aluffi, note that the categorical perspective won't be adopted heavily here.
<p>
<h3>Algebraic Geometry:</h3>
<p>
A good all-around (and inexpensive) book is <b>Hulek</b>'s <i>Elementary Algebraic
Geometry</i>. It contains pretty much all the algebraic geometry you'll need for this course.
<p>
Other excellent reads include <b>Smith, Kahanpaa, Kekalainen, Traves</b>'s
<a>An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry</i> and <b>Harris</b>'s <i>Algebraic Geometry:
A First Course</i>. Anyone wishing to seriously master the subject should master the
theory of schemes: read <b>Hartshorne</b>, <i>Algebraic Geometry</i>,
or <b>Vakil</b>, <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGsep1815public.pdf">The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry</a>. (By "read" I mean, as usual, "do all the exercises".)
<p>
<h3>Elementary Number Theory:</h3>
I recommend <b>Ireland and Rosen</b> or <b>Hardy and Wright</b>, or the lecture
notes from Matt Boylan's course. Another excellent resource is Filaseta's
<a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/filaseta/gradcourses/Math780.html">lecture notes</a>.

<h3>Algebraic Number Theory:</h3>
<p>
The gold standard is <b>Neukirch</b>, <i>Algebraic Number Theory</i>. An excellent
free alternative is <b>Milne</b>, <a href="http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/ANT.pdf">Algebraic Number Theory</a>.
