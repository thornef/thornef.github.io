<p>
This will be an introduction to analytic number theory, focusing on questions about the distribution
of the prime numbers. The course will aim to be simple and self-contained, while explaining the content and flavor
of contemporary research as quickly as possible. 
<p>
Want to learn how James Maynard proved the existence of 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.4600.pdf">small gaps between primes</a>?
How <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~harald.helfgott/anglais/">Harald Helfgott</a>
settled the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7748">ternary Goldbach conjecture</a>?
Then this is the course for you.
<p>
<b>Contact information</b>: Frank Thorne, LeConte 317-O, thorne [at] math [dot] sc [dot] edu.
<p>
<b>Schedule:</b> The class will meet 10:50-11:40, MWF.
<p>
<b>Office hours:</b> MW 9:00-10:00 or Tue 11:30-12:30. Alternatively, ask me questions before or after class or seminar.
<p>
<b>Learning outcomes.</b> Successful students will: see classical statements about the distribution of the primes,
and understand the methods used to prove them; understand how the "basic" statements can themselves be used in a variety
of applications; master foundational subjects such as asymptotic analysis, partial summation, contour integration, etc.; 
improve their knowledge and proficiency in analytic number theory in general.
<p>
<b>Prerequisites.</b> Graduate standing or permission of instructor. Students should either be enrolled in 701
and 703 concurrently, or have equivalent background.
<p>
<b>Grading.</b> <b>Homework</b> will be given regularly, and counts for 80% of your grade. Collaboration is strongly
encouraged, but please write up solutions on your own.
<p>
You are also expected to attend at least ten research talks during the seminar. These could be from any of the
following: the <a href="https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/beyond_classroom/colloquia_and_seminars/">
department colloquium</a>; the <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/algebra/seminar/">algebra, geometry, and number theory seminar</a>,
the <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/filaseta/numthryseminarsSPRING2019.html"> number theory seminar</a>, 
the <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/southwij/GradColloquium.html">graduate colloquium</a>, 
the <a href="https://webpages.uncc.edu/aroy15/PANTS/">Palmetto Number Theory Series</a>, or any other seminar
or conference talks you find interesting.
<p>
For each, you are asked to do Ravi Vakil's <a href="https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/threethings.html">Three Things Exercise</a>
(20% of your grade). I will do the same. <a href="three-things.txt">Here</a> are mine.

<p>
You are guaranteed an A for a 75+ average, B for 50+, C for 40+.
<p>
Students who have passed the comprehensive exam may be a negotiate a reduced workload (please ask).

<b>Textbook:</b>
<i>The Distribution of the Primes</i> by myself and
<a href="http://math.tufts.edu/faculty/rlemkeoliver/">Robert Lemke Oliver</a>. 

The book
is in preparation; free PDF copies will be uploaded here and updated frequently. 
<b>COMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS, AND CORRECTIONS FOR THE BOOK ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.</b>
<p>
I also strongly recommend 
Davenport's <i>Multiplicative Number Theory</i> as a general introduction to analytic number theory.
