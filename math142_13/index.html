<p>
<b>Welcome to Math 142!</b> Calculus is a beautiful, important, and fascinating subject.
<p>
It is also challenging. Please plan on a lot of hard work; we are here to help you succeed.

<p>
<i>"Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten."</i> -- B.F. Skinner
<p>
<b>Successful students will:</b>
<ul> 
<li>Have ample opportunities to practice and use <b>algebra</b>, <b>trigonometry</b>, and <b>first semester calculus</b>, increasing their skills in these areas. These topics are absolute prerequisities for Calculus II, 
but at the same time the course will be directed towards students whose background skills may
be <b>slightly</b> rusty and in need of practice.
<li>Understand <b>quantitative data</b> and its presentation. In calculus, this usually takes the shape of a 
<b>function</b>. Functions will be presented in terms of equations, or in terms of graphs,
or in English text, and students will be required to <b>seamlessly translate</b> between these.
<li>Develop the ability to explain their work clearly. As with the previous bullet point, this 
will involve a combination of equations, graphs, and English text. <b>Students are expected to learn to write well.</b>
<li>Understand what <b>definitions and theorems</b> are. The student will be able to give <b>precise definitions</b>
as well as <b>informal explanations</b> and will be able to <b>explain the correspondence.</b>
<li>Tackle problems that require more than one step to solve, or whose solution is not obvious. Typically this means that you <b>try
something</b>, and <b>if it doesn't work you try something else.</b>
</ul>
The above is true of any math class. Typically, all of this is best learned in some <i>specific</i> context. Therefore,
successful students will also:
<ul>
<li>
Master techniques for evaluating integrals and determining the convergence and divergence of series.
<li>
Learn a variety of applications of integration, including areas, volumes, and arc lengths.
<li>
Further study the relationship between calculus, algebra, and geometry, through the study of parametric curves,
polar coordinates, and various area and volume problems. A key point is understanding <i>alternative ways in which
functions may be represented.</i>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning. There is a ton of homework. It will be collected and graded.</b> That is because this is the most effective way for you
to learn. But:
<ul>
<li>
This class has
a 12-point curve (i.e. A=88, B=76, etc.) as opposed to the usual ten point curve. My standards are high and so I think it is fair
that you should have more wiggle room. 
<li>
All of the assignments for this course, including a complete list of questions that may
show up on the exams, are posted below. So <b>everything is completely predictable</b>, and you can look before you leap.
<li>
<b>My goal is that you will earn the highest grades of any 142 class.</b> To that end, I've made my expectations
very clear -- the standards are high, but you can meet them and it is my job to help you.
<li>
If the numerical average on any midterm exam is at least 76%, then we will have a pizza lunch (in class) the day I hand back the exams.
</ul>
<P>
<b>This class doesn't cover exactly the same material as most sections of Math 142.</b> Compared to 
a recent version of the course:
<ul>
<li>
We will <b>add</b> the sections on <b>arc length</b> (8.1) and <b>parametric curves</b> (10.1-10.2).
The purpose is to give you a greater understanding of the flexibility of calculus and its relation to geometry, 
and to introduce you to some subjects which you are likely to encounter again later.
<li>
We will emphasize <b>explicit approximation</b> for convergence tests. We will strongly keep in mind that
''converges'' means ''equals a number''.
<li>
We will de-emphasize the problem-solving aspect of convergence tests: whenever you are asked to determine
whether or not a series converges, a suitable test will be suggested to you. Also, a list of convergence tests
will be provided for you on the exams, which means that you won't have to memorize it.
</ul>

All exams will be held in the usual classroom, during class meetings (except for the final).
<p>
The <b>midterm exams</b> will be very similar to the homeworks, and several problems will be taken exactly
from the homework assignments. There will not be any topics on the exams that were not covered in the
homeworks.

<p>
Here is information about <a href="conv-tests.pdf">convergence tests</a>. This sheet will be added to as the
semester goes on, and <b>will be provided to you on Midterm 3 and on the final exam.</b> Therefore you should make sure that you <b>understand what everything here means and how to use it.</b> Please ask if you have any questions.
<p>
<font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:

Homework is due to your TA by 5:00 p.m., on Fridays except as otherwise noted below. (Your TA will tell you where to turn in your homework.)
The homework <b>will be graded and returned to you,</b> according to the following scheme. Each homework is
worth 10 points. Out of that, three problems will be selected each week (randomly, for the most part) and graded
carefully, and each is worth 2 points. The remaining 4 points are for overall quality and completion.
<p>
<b>All the homework assignments</b> can be downloaded from this website (see below).
<b>They are long.</b> Do not start the night before.<b>They are also very important.</b>
<p>
Each homework will have ''required'', ''additional'', and (one or more) ''bonus'' problems. 
The additional problems are not required; if you do them then the points taken off elsewhere will be reduced by up to 50%.
The bonus problems are extra credit.
<p>
As noted above, <b>all problems on the final exam will be taken verbatim from the homework assignments.</b> (This includes the
''additional'' problems, which is one reason to do them.) <i>If you are diligent in this course then there should be no
surprises.</i>
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 
 
<p>
You will be graded <b>both on correctness and on quality of exposition.</b> 
The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
The grade cutoffs are: A for 88%, B+ for 84%, B for 76%, C+ for 72%, C for 64%, and D for 50%.

<p>
Only <b>your highest two</b> midterm exam grades will be counted. Also, the above does not include the Calc I
exam the week of September 3. This exam will be counted 10% or 0% of your total, whichever makes your grade turn out higher.

<font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise, makeups will only be given in case of emergency.

Late homework will generally not be accepted, but please ask your TA if you have special circumstances.
<P>

<font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:

<p>

Calculators will not be allowed for the exams. You may use them on the homework if you want, but this is discouraged,
as the purpose of the homework is to prepare you for the exams.

<font size=+1> <b> Schedule of lectures, homeworks, and exams: </b> </font>
<p>   
On starred (*) days I will be out of town and a substitute will fill in for me.
<p>
Homeworks are not always due on the same days of the week. This could be a bit annoying (my apologies), but it was done
to make sure no one homework is excessively long.
<p>
At this point, homeworks are <i>slightly</i> subject to change, but:

and you can turn them in for extra credit. Each one is worth half a homework assignment, so you can
get extra credit equal to two homeworks total.

They are due at (or before) the final exam. If you finish them early,
bring them to me and I will grade them and give you feedback.
