\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item
What is the comparison test? Explain why it works.

\item
What is the limit comparison test? Explain (roughly) why it works.

\item
11.4, 3-16. For those series which converge, determine an explicit upper bound for the value
of the series.

\item
11.5, 2-6, 23-30, 32, 33. 
\end{enumerate}
Additional problems: 11.4, 17-22, 11.5, 7-12 (subject to same instructions as above)
\\
Bonus: Which of the convergence tests we have studied so far do you believe is best for which
kind of integrals? Explain thoroughly.
 (2 points): Who invented calculus? Use any sources you want (your
textbook, Wikipedia, whatever) and write a page addressing this question.
