\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Stewart, Ch. 6.1, 1-4.

\item
Stewart, Ch. 6.1, 5-18; even required, odd recommended.

\item
Stewart, Ch. 6.1, 42, 45. (In 42, do not worry about what the ``Midpoint Rule'' is;
just come up with a reasonable estimate for the area. There is a range of answers
I'd happily accept.)

\item
Find the volume of a sphere with radius $r$.

\item
Find the volume of a hollowed out sphere of radius $r$, with a smaller sphere
of radius $s$ removed from the center. (Hint: there is an easy way!)

\item
Find the volume of a circular cone of radius $r$ and height $h$.

\item
Find the area of a square pyramid with base length $b$ and height $b$.
\\
\\
{\bf Important.} For all volume problems, please sketch the solid whose volume
you are computing, and draw and label a typical slice.
\item
Stewart, Ch. 6.2, 1-10; even required, odd recommended.

\item
Stewart, Ch. 6.2, 41, 42, 51, 68, 70.

{\bf That's it!}
