There will be seven or eight questions on the exam. Only one of the questions
marked (*) will appear.


As before, the ``additional'' problems on the homeworks are fair game.

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
One problem from (a)-(d) or Section 4.7 on Homework 9, selected at random.

\item
One problem from Section 4.9 on Homework 9, selected at random.

\item
Problem (a), (b), or (l) on Homework 10, selected at random.
(If I ask (l), I {\bf might} ask only part of (l), but only if the
rest of the exam looks difficult.)

\item
(*) One problem from (c)-(k) on Homework 10, selected at random. With (c)-(e),
you will only be asked about four intervals.

\item
One problem from 49-52 of Stewart, Ch. 4.9, or 4 from Ch. 5.3, or
7 in the Chapter 5 Review, selected at random.

\item
One problem from Section 5.3 of Stewart on Homework 10 (excluding 4), 
or Chapter 4.9, 57 or 63,
selected at random.

\item
One problem from (b)-(d) or Section 5.4 on Homework 11, selected at random.

\item
One problem from (e) on Homework 11 or Section 5.5 on Homeworks 11-12, selected at random.
