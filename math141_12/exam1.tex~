There will be eight questions, all of them taken from the homework
assignments. Of the categories labelled ``50\% chance", two will be picked
at random.

``Random'' means that I will pick problems using a random number generator.
{\bf You can predict the exam as well as I can.}

Please note that the ``additional'' problems on the homeworks are fair game.

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
(50\% chance) One problem from Homework 2, (a)-(e) and additional (b)-(c), selected
at random.

\item
(50\% chance) One problem from Section 2.2 on Homework 2, selected at random.

\item
One problem from Section 2.3 on Homework 3, selected at random.

\item
One problem from Section 2.6 on Homework 3, selected at random.

\item
(50\% chance) One problem from Section 2.7 on Homework 3, excluding 11, 12, 17, selected at random.

\item
One problem from Section 2.8 (excluding 5-8, 41-43), or (a)-(b), on Homework 4, selected at random.

\item
One problem from Section 3.1, or (g)-(h), on Homework 4, selected at random.

\item
One problem from Section 3.2, or (k), on Homework 4, selected at random.
