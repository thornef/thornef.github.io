{\bf Required problems:}
\\
\\
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Suppose that you are given the graph of the function $y = f(x)$, and
you want to find the slope of the tangent line to the graph at the point
$(a, f(a))$. Explain how to guess this slope by
finding the slopes of secant lines.

\item
Given the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $y = f(x)$ at the point
$(a, f(a))$, explain how to find the equation of this line.

\item
By finding the slopes of appropriate secant lines, determine the equation
of the tangent line to $y = x^2$ at $(1, 1)$.

\item
By finding the slopes of appropriate secant lines, determine the equation
of the tangent line to $y = -x$ at $(4, -4)$.

\item
By finding the slopes of appropriate secant lines, determine the equation
of the tangent line to $y = x^3 - 3$ at $(1, -2)$.

\item

Additional problems:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Stewart, 2.2, 5, 6, 14.

\item
By finding the slopes of appropriate secant lines, determine the equation
of the tangent line to $y = 1/x$ at $(1, 1)$.

\item
By finding the slopes of appropriate secant lines, determine the equation
of the tangent line to $y = -1/x^2$ at $(2, -1/4)$.
\end{enumerate}
{\bf Bonus:} Describe a function and a point for which this process does not yield an
intelligent answer.
