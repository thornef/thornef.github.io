{\bf Core:}

3.2: 1, 5, 15, 16, 18, 25, 36.
\\
\\
3.2: 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 39, 41.
\\
\\
3.4: 21, 23, 31.
\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $f(x)$ is a function, what does it mean to say that $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = c$?
Write in English as well as using formal logic (i.e. the symbols $\forall$ and $\exists$)
Please don't write down the answer while looking at your notes! (It is important to know this from memory.)

\item
What does it mean to say that $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) \neq c$? Your answer should start
with ``There exists'' or ``There is''. Write in English as well as using formal logical notation.

\item
What does it mean to say that $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ does not exist? Again, answer both in English
and in formal notation.

\item
Prove that
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 3} x^2 = 9.$$

\item
Prove that
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 4} x + 5 \neq 7.$$

\item
Prove that
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x \sin x = 0.$$

\item
Prove that
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \cos(1/x)$$ does not exist.
\end{enumerate}
{\bf Additional:}

3.2, 2, 17, 19.
\\
\\
3.3, 4, 13-15, 33-36.
\\
\\
3.4, 22, 24.
\\
\\
{\bf Bonus:} (up to 4 points)
\\
\\
Find a variety of examples of valid and invalid arguments in nonmathematical sources such as:
newspapers (op-ed columnists are great), magazines, blogs, political speeches and debates,
or any other source not specifically dealing with mathematics or logic. Your answers may be a little
bit subjective and open to interpretation; if so, please explain.

Formalize the arguments using truth variables and/or predicates, and explain if appropriate. I would
be especially interested to see good examples of invalid arguments! (Remember that false premises don't
make an argument invalid.)

Please cite your sources (informally; no formal citation or bibliograhy is asked for, just say where they came from).

Good examples to look for are: modus ponens and modus tollens; a conditional is equivalent to its contrapositive;
converse or inverse error; valid or invalid negation of quantifiers.
