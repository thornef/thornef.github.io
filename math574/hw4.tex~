{\bf The discussions on writing proofs and common mistakes in Chapter 4.1 of your book are extremely useful.}
I strongly recommend that you read them carefully, especially if you are unfamiliar with writing proofs.

{\bf Core:}

4.1: 5, 11, 14, 18 (but only for $1 \leq n \leq 5$), 24, 31, 44, 45, 53.
\\
\\
4.2: 14, 17, 18, 28.
\\
\\
4.6: 3, 5, 10, 12, 15, 19, 21.

Determine whether each of the following statements is true or false, and prove or disprove each of them. (Feel free to apply the division with remainder
theorem.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $n$ is any odd integer, then $n^2$ is equal to $16 a + b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.

\item
If $n = 3k + 1$ for some integer $k$, then $n^2$ is equal to $3m + 1$ for some integer $m$.

\item
If $n = 3k + 1$ for some integer $k$, then $n^2$ is equal to $9m + 1$ for some integer $m$.

\item
If $n = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k$, then $n^2$ is equal to $8m + 1$ for some integer $m$.

\item
If $n = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k$, then $n^2$ is equal to $16m + 1$ for some integer $m$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (3 points; partial credit for some special cases)
Determine, with proof, for which integers $m$ the following statement is true:

For each integer $n$ that satisfies $n = am + 1$ for some integer $a$, we have
$n^2 = bm^2 + 1$ for some integer $m$.

\item (2 points)
Prove:

Let $P(x) = a_k x^k + a_{k - 1} x^{k - 1} + \cdots + a_1 x$ be a polynomial in $n$ without a constant term.
Then, $P(n)$ is even for all integers $n$ if and only if the sum $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k$ is even.
