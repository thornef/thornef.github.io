{\bf Instructions:} Please give numerical answers to all questions, except any involving $11!$
or higher, in which case you may answer in terms of factorials.

Please do not give bare answers to any question; add a little bit of explanation, although not so
much is necessary as to be considered a `proof'. For most problems, about one sentence will be good.
