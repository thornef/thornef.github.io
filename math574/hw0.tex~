{\bf Due Friday, January 14}

This is a preliminary homework, which will let me know where you are starting from and which
will give you an idea for what we will study in this course. {\bf Please do the best you can,
do not use any books or notes, and don't take longer than three hours total.} If you appear to
have made a reasonable effort, you will get full credit for this assignment.

If you have difficulties (or no idea) with any of the problems, then please plan on putting in 
hard work, and I will do my best to help you master this material!

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
Consider the sets $S = \{a, b, x\}$ and $T = \{c, x\}$. 
List all the subsets of $S$ and of $T$. What are the union and intersection of $S$ and $T$?
Describe a function (your choice) from $S$ to $T$.

\item
Socrates is a man. All men are mortal. Does it follow that Socrates is mortal?

\item
Aristotle is mortal. All men are mortal. Does it follow that Aristotle is a man?

\item
Prove the following: For every integer $n$, there exists an integer $m$ which is bigger than $n$.

\item
Prove that $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \cdots = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$.

\item
Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is always even.

\item
Prove that there is no positive number which is smaller than all other positive integers.

\item
South Carolina license tags consist of three letters and three numbers. How many different
license tags can be created?

\item
Suppose that no letter can be repeated. How many different license tags can be created now?

\item
You are walking in a city which is laid out in a grid. You want to walk four blocks north and
four blocks east. At every step you can choose whether to walk north or east. For example, you could
walk four blocks east, then four blocks north; or one block east, two blocks north, one block east,
two blocks north, two blocks east. Any direction is fine.

How many different ways are there to reach your destination?
