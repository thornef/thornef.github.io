<FONT SIZE =+2> <B> Course information and learning outcomes: </B> </Font>

<p>
Students will master foundational concepts in discrete mathematics, including:
set theory, logic, proof techniques (induction, contradiction, and others),
and elementary combinatorics (counting techniques).

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
Susanna Epp, <i>Discrete Mathematics: Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning</i>, brief edition.
You can buy it from Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Introduction-Mathematical-Reasoning/dp/0495826170/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1320966083&sr=1-4">here</a>, for over $30 less than the campus bookstore
is charging.
<p>
Update: The bookstore <i>doesn't even have it</i> (??!) despite the fact
that I requested it six weeks ago, and the manager
has not responded to my inquiries. Please buy the book online.

<p>
<b>Office Hours</b>: Mon., April 23 and Tue., April 24, 1:30-2:30. Monday and Tuesday, April 30-May 1,

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:
<p>
<b> WARNING. I assign a lot of homework.</b>
<p>
The homework is intended to take 6-8 hours a week (which is a lot of effort). Please
count on making a consistent effort to do well in this class! Note that starting the night before will
not be good enough. If homework takes you more than 8 hours on any given week then please let me know.
<p>
(Grading details, TBA)
<P>
There will be a few <b>bonus</b> problems on each homework, each worth one or two points, up to a maximum
score of 11/10 on each week's homework. The bonus homework is intended to let you skip some (not all) of
the more routine exercises if you feel like attempting something more difficult.
<p>
<a href="574-hw-sols.pdf">Some homework solutions</a>.

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
<b>WARNING</b>. You will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. Indeed, a major
focus of Math 574 is the ability to communicate mathematical ideas clearly.
<b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
In particular, please write in <b>complete English sentences</b> where appropriate (in particular, where
writing proofs.)

Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.
<p>
<b>Exams</b> will have a variety of questions. Some questions will be chosen directly from the
homework assignments, and most will at least be similar to homework problems.

<p>
<b>Grading scale</b>: A = 90+, B+ = 85+, B = 78+, C+ = 73+, C = 66+, D = 52+. 
<p>
<b>Please note that my grading scale is more generous than the usual 10-point scale.</b> However,
I am a (slightly) stricter grader than most.
This is intended
to balance out.

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Contacting me </b> </font>:

<b>Please contact me if you have any questions about the course, about my expectations, about my lectures,
about the homeworks, about the reading, or about anything else</b>. The syllabus is demanding and it is my
job to help you succeed.

The best ways to get help are to come to office hours (no appointment necessary) or to e-mail me (I will
almost always reply within 24 hours). If neither of these work for you then please e-mail me to set up an
appointment.

<P>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Feedback </b> </font>:

This is my first time teaching Math 574 at the University of South Carolina.
<b>I would be grateful to receive any and all feedback.</b> If your feedback is critical and
you would like to be anonymous, consider signing up for a Yahoo or Gmail account and e-mailing
from there (I will cheerfully respond).

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.

Late homework will be accepted <b>once per student</b>, up to a week late; after that, no late homework please
except in case of emergency.
<p>
<b>Academic honesty</b> and <b>attendance</b> are expected of all students.
