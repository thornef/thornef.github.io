(10 points:) Suppose you want to travel $n$ blocks north and $n$ blocks east on a square city
grid, travelling north or east at every step. With no restrictions, we showed that 
there are ${2n \choose n}$ ways to do this.

Suppose now we draw the diagonal between the starting spot and the final destination, and specify
that we are never allowed to go below the diagonal. With this restriction, there are now only
$\frac{1}{2n + 1} {2n \choose n}$ possibilities.

Prove this.
