As always, please show your work and explain yourself clearly. If this homework
takes more than ten hours, please bring this to my attention.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Suppose that you are given the graph of the function $y = f(x)$, and
you want to find the slope of the tangent line to the graph at the point
$(a, f(a))$. Explain how to guess this slope by
finding the slopes of secant lines.

\item
Given the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $y = f(x)$ at the point
$(a, f(a))$, explain how to find the equation of this line.

\item
By finding the slopes of appropriate secant lines, determine the equation
of the tangent line to $y = x^2$ at $(1, 1)$.

\item
By finding the slopes of appropriate secant lines, determine the equation
of the tangent line to $y = -x$ at $(4, -4)$.

\item
By finding the slopes of appropriate secant lines, determine the equation
of the tangent line to $y = x^3 - 3$ at $(1, -2)$.

\item
Stewart, Ch. 2.2, 1-4, 7, 9, 13.

\item
Stewart, Ch. 2.3, 11-30, 40, 42.

For this part only, the even problems are required and the odd problems
are strongly recommended.

\item
Consider the following definition of a limit: `We say that
$\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = c$ if $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to
$c$ as $x$ gets closer and closer to $a$.'

What is wrong with this definition?

\item
Give the definition of a limit, e.g., 
explain what it means to say that $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = c$.
You may explain in words, or using the $\epsilon-\delta$ formalism.

\item 
Explain what it means for a function $f(x)$ to be continuous.
(The informal definition is okay.)

\item
Stewart, Ch. 2.5, 7-8.

\item
Graph the following functions. Which are continuous? For the functions
that are not continuous, explain why.

$f(x) = x^2$, $f(x) = \sin(x)$, $f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2}$,
$f(x) = \frac{x - 1}{x^2 - 1}$, $f(x) = e^x.$

\end{enumerate}
