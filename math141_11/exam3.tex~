\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
What is a definite integral? Explain thoroughly and draw a picture. (Hint: Your explanation
should include an equation with a limit in it.)

\item
Sketch the graph of $f(x) = 2 + 2x^2 - x^4$. In addition, find the intervals of increase
and decrease, the local maximum and minimum values, and find where the graph is concave up
and concave down.

\item
The graphs of $f$ and three other functions are shown. Which graph is an antiderivative
of $f$, and why?

\item
A box with a square base and open top must have a volume of 32 $cm^3$. Find the dimensions
of the box that minimize the amount of material used.

\item
A 10 foot ladder rests on a wall and is sliding down the wall (and the bottom is sliding
away from the wall). If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a speed of
2 $ft/s$, how fast is the angle between the top of the ladder and the wall changing when
the angle is $\pi/4$ radians?

\item
Evaluate
$$\int x (2 - x)^2 dx.$$

\item
Evaluate
$$\int_0^3 x \sqrt{9 - x^2} dx.$$
