\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Stewart, Chapter 3 Review (pp. 262-263), 15-40, 57-61, 65-66, 83-84; even required, odd recommended.

\item
Stewart, Ch. 3.9, 11-34; even required, odd recommended. You do not have to follow Stewart's
(a)-(e) exactly (although this is a very good idea!) but with these problems especially, 
you should {\bf explain what you are doing}
in complete sentences and {\bf draw a picture} if appropriate.

\item
Define the terms {\itshape local maximum}, {\itshape local minimum}, {\itshape absolute maximum},
{itshape absolute minimum}, and {\itshape critical number}.

\item
Describe how to find all the critical numbers of a function.

\item
Describe how to find all the local maxima of a function.

\item
(Trick question. Explain why.) Explain how to find all the absolute maxima of a function.

\item
Stewart, Ch. 4.1, 7-10, 13-14, 21-28, 47-60; even required, odd recommended.
