\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
Verify that the function $f(x) = 5 - 12x + 3x^2$ satisfies the hypotheses of Rolle's
Theorem on the interval $[1, 3]$. Then, find all numbers $c$ that satisfy the conclusion
of Rolle's theorem.

\item
Sketch the graph of the function $h(x) = x^5 - x$. In addition, find the intervals
of increase or decrease, find the local maximum and minimum values, and find where the graph
is concave up and concave down.

\item
Given the graph on Stewart, p. 345, Problem 51, sketch an antiderivative $F$, given that
$F(0) = 1$.

\item
A farmer wants to fence an area of 15,000 square feet in a rectangular field and then
divide it in half with a fence parallel to one of the sides of the rectangle. How can he
do this so as to minimize the total length of the fence?

\item
Two sides of a triangle are 4 m and 5 m in length and the angle between them is increasing at
a rate of 0.06 radians per second. Find the rate at which the area of the triangle is increasing,
when the angle between the sides of fixed length is $\pi/3$.

\item
What is wrong with this?
$$ \int_{-2}^1 x^{-4} dx = \frac{x^{-3}}{-3} \bigg|_{-2}^1 = - \frac{3}{8}.$$

\item
Evaluate
$$\int_1^2 \frac{4 + u^2}{u^3} du.$$
