<FONT SIZE =+2> <B> Course information and learning outcomes: </B> </Font>

<p>
Calculus is a beautiful subject dating back to Newton, Leibniz, and Gauss. A student who completes Math 141 will
master concepts and gain skills related to functions and graphs, limits, derivatives, and integrals, and applications related 
to all of the above. The successful student will also refine his/her abilities in problem solving, abstract reasoning, and
mathematical writing. Finally, although this will not be an emphasis of the course,
the student will gain introductory exposure to theorems, proofs, and the rigorous side of mathematics.
<p>
<b>Calculus is difficult</b>, but we have every confidence in your ability to succeed.
You <b>must</b> spend subsantial effort outside of class in order to learn the subject well.
<b>We are here to help you</b>. Please come to office hours as often as you wish; no appointment is necessary. I will also hang around
before and after class to answer questions. You may also e-mail me at thornef [at] mailbox.sc.edu, to
set up an appointment or to ask questions over e-mail. I will try to respond within 24 hours.

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Text </b> </font>: 
James Stewart, <i> Calculus, Early Transcendentals, </i> 6th edition. We will use a custom
edition of this book, available in the campus bookstore.
<p>
Unfortunately it is not the official text, but <a href="http://djm.cc/library/Calculus_Made_Easy_Thompson.pdf">
Calculus Made Easy</a> by Silvanus Thompson, published in 1914, is still the best calculus book ever written.
Read the epilogue on p. 283 if you don't believe me.

Practice Final: Do any sixteen problems, including one from 1-9, from the

up to sixteen problems by December 7. E-mail me a list of what problems you want

to the problems requested most often.


<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:

Homework is due to your TA by 5:00 p.m. each Friday. (Your TA will tell you where to turn in your homework.)
The homework <b>will be graded and returned to you,</b> according to the following scheme. Each homework is
worth 10 points. Out of that, three problems will be selected each week (randomly, for the most part) and graded
carefully, and each is worth 2 points. The remaining 4 points are for overall quality and completion.
<p>
The homework assignments will all be posted to this website at least a week in advance. <b>The homeworks will be long. Do not start the night before.</b>
Doing the homeworks
is the most important thing you should do to learn calculus; in particular, this is much more important than my lectures.
<p>
The homework assignments are designed to be a good guide to what is expected of you. Therefore, <b>at least 80% of
the questions on all of the exams will be taken verbatim from the homework,</b> for the most part randomly. Homework
questions that are recommended but not required are fair game.
<P>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
<b>WARNING</b>. You will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. 
<b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.

<p>
You are guaranteed an A for 88%, a B for 76%, a C for 64%, and a D for 50%. These cutoffs <i>may</i> be lowered
slightly if I determine (in consultation with other faculty) that the difficulty of the homework and exams merits it,
but please do not count on it. These cutoffs are guaranteed not to be raised.

<P>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Make-up policy </b> </font>:

<p>

If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.

Late homework will generally not be accepted; in case of emergency please speak with your TA. 
<P>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Calculators </b> </font>:

<p>

Calculators will not be allowed for the exams. You may use them on the homework if you want, but this is discouraged,
as the purpose of the homework is to prepare you for the exams.

<font size=+1> <b> Supplemental instruction </b> </font>:

<p>

<b>Lauren Huber</b> runs the supplemental instruction sessions. This is a
valuable resource and you are strongly encouraged to take advantage of it.
Please go to ask questions and meet other students. It is a particularly
good place to
work on your homework.
<p>
These sessions run <b>Sunday 7:00-7:50, Monday 9:00-9:50, Thursday
4:00-4:50</b> in Thomas Cooper Library, Supplemental Instruction Room 3.
(All times PM.)

<P> 
There is also <b>free drop-in tutoring</b> available Monday through Thursday,
from 10:00-4:00 in LeConte 105. The tutoring is run by math grad students
(most of whom are TAs); please take advantage of this valuable resource as well.
