Welcome to Math 580! This course will be awesome, and a real homepage will be here too.
<p>
The required textbook is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Number-Theory-Edition-Mathematics/dp/048646931X/">Elementary Number Theory</a> by Underwood Dudley. Slightly old-fashioned, but a delightful book, and the price is right.
<p>
If you want something less old-fashioned, <a href="http://shop.mcgraw-hill.com/mhshop/productDetails?isbn=0073383147&category=3661">this book</a> -- previous editions of which have been used here at USC -- is now in its <b>seventh edition!</b>
<p>
Why produce seven additions of an elementary number theory book? Surely the subject is old and classical. Are big new theorems being proven in the subject?

<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2897.pdf">yes</a>. But these aren't covered in Burton's book, not even in the seventh edition, so why not find something better to do with $209.67?
