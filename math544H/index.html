Successful students will:
<ul>
<li>
Understand the concept of a real <b>vector space</b> from an algebraic and a geometric point of view. The student will master related concepts such as bases and linear independence, norms, inner products, and so forth.
<li>
Understand the most important maps between vector spaces -- the 
<b>linear transformations</b>. The successful student will be able to describe
their structure and describe it in terms of ranks, nullspaces, etc.
<li>
Understand how to manipulate <b>matrices</b> and explain the correspondence between
matrices and linear transformations.
<li>
Understand what <b>eigenvalues</b> are, why they are interesting, and why one would
want to compute them.
<li>
See applications of all of the above to engineering and physical and social sciences. To give just one example --- at the heart of Google search is an eigenvalue. (The student
will <b>not</b> <i>master</i> this over the course of only one semester! If you give it thirty years, maybe. But people are developing new applications for linear algebra all the time.)
<li>
Develop their ability to understand and explain rigorous mathematics and prove simple statements. This is a 500-level math class, and as such <b>proofs will be required on homeworks and exams</b>. If you have limited background in proofs, then this course will help bolster it.
</ul>

<FONT SIZE =+1> <B> Course non-objectives/learning non-outcomes: </B> </Font> </p>
Linear algebra is too big of a subject to really do justice to in one semester. Therefore we will mostly omit some beautiful topics.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The course will probably say little about the very interesting and important questions
when doing linear algebra in the "real world" -- which involves imprecise measurements and computational precision issues. This beautiful topic will be emphasized in other courses.
<li>The course will develop only a minimal amount of formalism -- so the vector space axioms, fields other than R, infinite-dimensional vector spaces, inner products other than the "obvious" one coming from geometry, etc. will not be talked about much. This material would be more appropriate in a more advanced course.

Please see me at the end of the term, or pursue a relevant term project, if you would be interested in learning more about these aspects of the subject.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning.</b> You should expect 5-8 hours of homework a week in this class, which is more than most other instructors assign; 
in my experience there is no other way to learn the material. Your consistent effort will certainly lead to improved understanding,
and it will almost certainly lead to you earning high grades.
<P>

<p>
The book is available by clicking the link above, or directly <a href="hefferon.pdf">here</a>.
<b>It is completely free.</b> You can also purchase a cheap printed copy if you like.
<p>
<b>Thanks to the author for making this high quality material available for free!</b> If you enjoy his books,
please consider contacting them directly and saying so.

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Lectures </b> </font>: 9:40-10:30, MWF, LC 348.

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>: The exams will be <b>take home and pledged</b>, of two hours duration. 
You will have at least a 72 hour window to complete them, at a time of your choosing.
<b>Dates will
be announced at least a week in advance</b>.
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Homework</b> </font>: <b> Warning. I assign a lot of homework.</b>
The homework is intended to take 5-8 hours a week. That is a lot. Please
count on making a consistent effort to do well in this class! Starting the night before is a bad idea.
If homework takes you more than 10 hours on any given week, then that is more than I intended;
please let me know.
<p>
There will also be at least one <b>bonus</b> problem on each homework. 
<p>

<p>
<b>Please note</b>. You will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. Indeed, a major
focus of Math 544 is the ability to communicate mathematical ideas clearly.
<b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
In particular, please write in <b>complete English sentences</b> and draw <b>clear diagrams</b> where appropriate.

Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Final project </b> </font>:
<p>
Instead of a final exam, this course will ask you to do a <b>final project</b> on some aspect of linear
algebra. The choice of topic is up to you; possible topics include: theoretical aspects of linear algebra;
computational aspects of linear algebra; connections to other areas of math; applications to statistics,
computer science, engineering, and the natural or social sciences.
<p>
The project will consist of an initial proposal, a term paper, and a 20-minute presentation during the final exam period. 
Group work is encouraged. <b>More details will be announced.</b>
<p>

<b>Grading scale</b>: You are guaranteed at least the following grades: A = 88+, B+ = 83+, B = 75, C+ = 70+, C = 60+, D = 50+.

<b>Please contact me if you have any questions about the course, about my expectations, about my lectures,
about the homeworks, about the reading, or about anything else</b>. The syllabus is demanding and it is my
job to help you succeed.

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Policies </b> </font>:

<p>
If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise makeup exams will be given only in case of illness or emergency.
<p>
Late homework will in general only be accepted in case of illness or emergency.

<p>
<b>Academic honesty</b> and <b>attendance</b> are expected of all students.
