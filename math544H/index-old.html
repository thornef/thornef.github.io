<b>Instructor:</b> Frank Thorne, LeConte 317O, thorne [at] math [dot] sc [dot] edu
<p>
<b>Office Hours:</b> TBA
<p>
<b>Course Delivery:</b> <b>The class will be held in-person to the extent feasible, with some online classes.</b>
We will meet in person on the first day, and then move online for at least a week. In-person courses will resume
when Covid testing shows a small number of cases (similar to Fall 2020, from mid-September on).

<FONT SIZE =+1> <B> Course objectives/learning outcomes: </B> </Font> </p>
Successful students will:
<ul>
<li>
Understand the concept of a real <b>vector space</b> from an algebraic and a geometric point of view. The student will master related concepts such as bases and linear independence, norms, inner products, and so forth.
<li>
Understand the most important maps between vector spaces -- the 
<b>linear transformations</b>. The successful student will be able to describe
their structure and describe it in terms of ranks, nullspaces, etc.
<li>
Understand how to manipulate <b>matrices</b> and explain the correspondence between
matrices and linear transformations.
<li>
Understand what <b>eigenvalues</b> are, why they are interesting, and why one would
want to compute them.
<li>
See applications of all of the above to engineering and physical and social sciences. To give just one example --- at the heart of Google search is an eigenvalue. (The student
will <b>not</b> <i>master</i> this over the course of only one semester! If you give it thirty years, maybe. But people are developing new applications for linear algebra all the time.)
<li>
Develop their ability to understand and explain rigorous mathematics and prove simple statements. This is a 500-level math class, and as such <b>proofs will be required on homeworks and exams</b>. If you have limited background in proofs, then this course will help bolster it.
</ul>

<FONT SIZE =+1> <B> Course non-objectives/learning non-outcomes: </B> </Font> </p>
Linear algebra is too big of a subject to really do justice to in one semester. Therefore we will mostly omit some beautiful topics.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The course will say little about the very interesting and important questions
when doing linear algebra in the "real world" -- which involves imprecise measurements and computational precision issues. The student who would like to see this beautiful topic emphasized should instead take <b>Math 526</b>.
<li>The course will develop only a minimal amount of formalism -- so the vector space axioms, fields other than R, infinite-dimensional vector spaces, inner products other than the "obvious" one coming from geometry, etc. will not be talked about much. This material would be more appropriate if the course had prerequisites such as Math 300 and Math 574. 

Please see me at the end of the term if you would be interested in learning more about this aspect of the subject.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning.</b> You should expect 5-8 hours of homework a week in this class, which is more than most other instructors assign; 
in my experience there is no other way to learn the material. Your consistent effort will certainly lead to improved understanding,
and it will almost certainly lead to you earning high grades.
<P>


<hr>
<font size=+1> <b> Texts </b> </font>: The course will use <b>open educational resources</b>, which are freely available
online:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/math/hefferon.html">Jim Hefferon</a>, 
<a href="https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/">Linear Algebra</a> (fourth edition).
<li>
<a href="https://people.math.gatech.edu/~dmargalit7/index.shtml">Dan Margalit</a> and 
<a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~jdr/">Joseph Rabinoff</a>,
<a href="https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/">Interactive Linear Algebra</a>.
</ul>
The books are available by clicking the links above. <b>We will mostly be following Hefferon</b> -- click on the link above
to download a PDF. You can also purchase a cheap printed copy if you like.
<p>
Margalit-Rabinoff is best accessed on the web directly. It comes with interactive, graphical widgets which illustrate
the geometric nature of the subject. <b>You are strongly encouraged to play around with them!</b>
<p>
<b>Thanks to the authors for making this high quality material available for free!</b> If you enjoy their books,
please consider contacting them directly and saying so.

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Lectures </b> </font>: 12:00-12:50, MWF.
Ideally most will be in-person in LeConte 101, but some will be given via Zoom as the pandemic 

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Exam schedule </b> </font>: TBA.
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Homework and Quizzes</b> </font>:
<p>
<b> Warning. I assign a lot of homework.</b>
<p>
The homework is intended to take 5-8 hours a week. That is a lot. Please
count on making a consistent effort to do well in this class! Starting the night before is a bad idea.
<p>
If homework takes you more than 10 hours on any given week, then that is more than I intended;
please let me know.
<p>
There will be at least one <b>bonus</b> problem on each homework. 
<p>

<p>
<b>Please note</b>. You will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. Indeed, a major
focus of Math 544 is the ability to communicate mathematical ideas clearly.
<b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
In particular, please write in <b>complete English sentences</b> and draw <b>clear diagrams</b> where appropriate.

Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.
<p>
<b>Grading scale</b>: You are guaranteed at least the following grades: A = 88+, B+ = 83+, B = 75, C+ = 70+, C = 60+, D = 50+.

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Contacting me </b> </font>:

<b>Please contact me if you have any questions about the course, about my expectations, about my lectures,
about the homeworks, about the reading, or about anything else</b>. The syllabus is demanding and it is my
job to help you succeed.

<p>

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Policies </b> </font>:

<p>
If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the exams it is your responsibility to inform me <b>at least a week before</b> the exam.
Otherwise makeup exams will be given only in case of illness or emergency.
<p>
Late homework will not be accepted, and makeup quizzes will not be given, except in cases of medical emergency. Instead, your lowest two grades will be dropped.
<p>
<b>Academic honesty</b> and <b>attendance</b> are expected of all students.
<P>

<b>Calculators</b> will not be needed or allowed.
