Successful students will:
<ul>
<p><li>Understand the geometry of 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and be able to answer questions related to lengths, distances, and related topics.
<p><li>Understand the concept of a vector, including dot and cross products, be able to explain its relationship to geometry, and work problems involving vectors.
<p><li>Work problems involving derivatives and integrals in multiple variables.
<p><li>Work problems involving derivatives and integrals of vector-valued functions.
<p><li>Practice good mathematical writing. In mathematics, as indeed in everything else, it is important not only to be correct but to explain yourself clearly and as simply as possible.
<p><li>Gain mathematical maturity, and be prepared to take more advanced 
math classes if desired.
</ul>

scheduled by the registrar.
<p>
At least half of all exam questions will be taken verbatim from the homework assignments. You should also be prepared for questions that ask you to explain the main concepts of the course and their relation to each other.
<p>
<b>Crib sheets</b> will be allowed: a 4-by-6 index card for each midterm, and an 8 1/2-by-11 sheet of paper for the final exam. You may write anything you like on these, front and back, as long as you prepare and handwrite them yourself, and you don't copy from any other student. 

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:
Homework will be assigned approximately weekly. You are not required to turn it in, but:
<ul>
<p><li>All quiz questions will be taken verbatim from the homework.
<p><li>At least half of all exam questions will be taken verbatim from the homework. 
<p><li>If you turn in the homework with the corresponding quiz, then you can make up points lost on the quiz. 
</ul>
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Quizzes:</b> </font> Quizzes will be given approximately once a week, and announced at least one class period in advance.
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Survey:</b> </font> A survey, separate from the university course evaluations, will be distributed online at the end of the term.
<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Attendance Verification Quiz:</b> </font>
You are also required to fill out an "attendance verification quiz" on Blackboard, by university policy. (Details will be announced.)

<FONT SIZE =+2> <B> Grading: </B> </Font> </p>

<p>
<b>Please note</b>. You will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. <b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
In particular, you should write in <b>complete English sentences</b> and draw <b>clear diagrams</b> where appropriate.

Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.
<p>
<b>Grading scale</b>: You are guaranteed at least the following: A = 88+, B+ = 83+, B = 76+, C+ = 71+, C = 64+, D = 50+. 
<p>
<b>Please note that my grading scale is more generous than the usual 10-point scale.</b> However,
I am a (slightly) stricter grader than most.
This is intended
to balance out.

<FONT SIZE =+2> <B> Course Policies: </B> </Font> </p>

<ul>
<p><li>Academic honesty</b> is expected of all students. Collaboration on homework is encouraged, but do not copy anyone else's writeup. 

<p><li><b>Attendance</b> is expected of all students. Roll will not be taken. In case of excused absences, you are welcome to go through formal channels; alternatively, unless you are missing many classes or are asking to make up an exam, an email letting me know the circumstances will suffice.

<p><li>Makeup quizzes and exams</b>: Quizzes and exams may be made up in case of illness, emergency, or university-sanctioned absence (including religious observances). Barring extremely unusual circumstances, advance notice must be given (in case of university-sanctioned absence, at least a week in advance).

<p><li> If you have difficulty seeing the board or hearing the lectures, or 
a related problem, let me know ASAP,</b> and I will do something
about it. 

<p><li> Harassment, bullying, racism, sexism, and homophobia will not be tolerated, and flagrant or repeated violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
Please bring any incidents which I don't notice to my attention.

<p><li>If you require <b>disability-related accommodations</b>, please talk to the 
<a href="https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/">Student Disability
Resource Center</a> as soon as possible. It is your responsibility to advise me of any needed accomodations
a week in advance.

<p><li>
<b>Please contact me if you have any questions about the course, about my expectations, about my lectures,
about the homeworks, about the reading, or about anything else</b>. The syllabus is demanding and it is my
job to help you succeed.

The best ways to get help are to come to office hours (no appointment necessary) or to e-mail me (during the week, I will
almost always reply within 24 hours). If neither of these work for you then please e-mail me to set up an
appointment.

<p>
You can also seek help at the <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_success_center/index.php">Student Success Center</a>. They offer peer tutoring
in the subject matter, and can also give advice on time management and study skills. 
</ul>

<FONT SIZE =+2> <B> Rough Course Schedule: </B> </Font> </p>
 
<p>
The plan is to cover the following chapters from OpenStax:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Vectors In Space</b> (2.1-2.7): 3 weeks
<p><li><b>Vector-Valued Functions</b> (3.1-3.4): 2 weeks
<p><li><b>Differentiation in Multiple Variables</b> (4.1-4.8): 3 weeks
<p><li><b>Integration in Multiple Variables</b> (5.1-5.7): 4 weeks
<p><li><b>Vector Calculus</b> (6.1-6.4): 2 weeks
</ul>
<p>
Timing is approximate, and minor changes may be made if necessary. More details will be announced as the course progresses.
<p>
Unfortunately we won't have time to cover the following:
<ul>
<p><li>Parametric and Polar Coordinates (1.1-1.5): Hopefully this is familiar from previous coursework. We might do a bit of review, if necessary.
<p><li>More Vector Calculus (6.5-6.8): This is beautiful material, covered in Math 550.
<p><li>Differential Equations (7.1-7.4): Very important stuff, covered in Math 242 or 520.
</ul>
