Successful students will:
<ul>
<p><li>Understand the geometry of 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and be able to answer questions related to lengths, distances, and related topics.
<p><li>Understand the concept of a vector, including dot and cross products, be able to explain its relationship to geometry, and work problems involving vectors.
<p><li>Work problems involving derivatives and integrals in multiple variables.
<p><li>Work problems involving derivatives and integrals of vector-valued functions.
<p><li>Practice good mathematical writing. In mathematics, as indeed in everything else, it is important not only to be correct but to explain yourself clearly and as simply as possible.
<p><li>Gain mathematical maturity, and be prepared to take more advanced 
math classes if desired.
</ul>

which may be freely (and completely legally) downloaded from the above link. 
<p> 
A printed copy is not required, but if you want one you can buy one from the above link, from the campus bookstore, or from online book sellers. The color version is preferred over the black and white version. 
<p>
<b>The Thomas book is not required</b>. (It is in most sections of 241.) If you bought one for this course, please contact the bookstore for a refund. 

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Exams</b> </font>: There will be <b>two in-class midterms</b>; dates will be announced later in the term, at least a week in advance of the exam.
The <b>final exam</b> will be given Monday, December 9, 9:00-11:30 as
scheduled by the registrar.
<p>
At least half of all exam questions will be taken verbatim from the homework assignments. All other questions will either be similar to homework questions, or will be taken from the list of "concept questions" described below. 


<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Homework </b> </font>:
Homework will be assigned weekly. You are not required to turn it in, but:
<ul>
<p><li>All quiz questions will be taken verbatim from the homework.
<p><li>At least half of all exam questions will be taken verbatim from the homework. 
<p><li>If you turn in the homework with the corresponding quiz, then you can make up points lost on the quiz. 
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Quizzes:</b> </font> Quizzes will be given approximately once a week, and announced at least one class period in advance.

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Concept Questions:</b> </font> A (fairly short) list of <b>concept questions</b> will be compiled as the course progresses. These questions will ask you to explain the big-picture concepts of the course, using English prose, examples, and diagrams.
<p>
<b>Study them carefully. Each midterm will include one of these questions, and the final will include more than one.</b> These will be taken verbatim from the list provided. 
<p>
 
<b>Makeup quizzes and exams</b>: Quizzes and exams may be made up in case of illness, emergency, or university-sanctioned absence. Barring extremely unusual circumstances, advance notice must be given (in case of university-sanctioned absence, at least a week in advance).

<p>
<li> <font size=+1> <b> Grading </b> </font>: 

<p>
<b>Please note</b>. You will be graded both on correctness and on quality of exposition. <b>The standard is that someone who doesn't know the answer should be able to easily follow your work.</b>
In particular, you should write in <b>complete English sentences</b> and draw <b>clear diagrams</b> where appropriate.

Any work that is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly explained will not receive full credit.
<p>
<b>Grading scale</b>: You are guaranteed at least the following: A = 88+, B+ = 83+, B = 76+, C+ = 71+, C = 64+, D = 50+. 
<p>
<b>Please note that my grading scale is more generous than the usual 10-point scale.</b> However,
I am a (slightly) stricter grader than most.
This is intended
to balance out.

<li> <font size=+1> <b> Getting help </b> </font>:

<b>Please contact me if you have any questions about the course, about my expectations, about my lectures,
about the homeworks, about the reading, or about anything else</b>. The syllabus is demanding and it is my
job to help you succeed.

The best ways to get help are to come to office hours (no appointment necessary) or to e-mail me (during the week, I will
almost always reply within 24 hours). If neither of these work for you then please e-mail me to set up an
appointment.

<p>
You can also seek help at the <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_success_center/index.php>Student Success Center</a>. They offer peer tutoring
in the subject matter, and can also give advice on time management and study skills.

<FONT SIZE =+2> <B> Course Policies: </B> </Font> </p>

<p><li>Academic honesty</b> and <b>attendance</b> are expected of all students. Roll will not be taken. In case of excused absences, you are welcome to go through formal channels; alternatively, unless you are missing many classes or are asking to make up an exam, an email letting me know the circumstances will suffice.

<p><li> If you have difficulty seeing the board or hearing the lectures, or 
a related problem, let me know ASAP,</b> and I will do something
about it. 

<p><li> Harassment, bullying, racism, sexism, and homophobia will not be tolerated. Please bring any incidents which I don't notice to my attention.

<p><li>If you require <b>disability-related accommodations</b>, please talk to the 
<a href="https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/">Student Disability
Resource Center</a> as soon as possible. It is your responsibility to advise me of any needed accomodations
a week in advance.
</ul>

<HR>
<FONT SIZE =+2> <B> Rough Course Schedule: </B> </Font> </p>
 
<p>
The plan is to cover the following chapters from OpenStax:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Vectors In Space</b> (2.1-2.7): 3 weeks
<p><li><b>Vector-Valued Functions</b> (3.1-3.4): 2 weeks
<p><li><b>Differentiation in Multiple Variables</b> (4.1-4.8): 3 weeks
<p><li><b>Integration in Multiple Variables</b> (5.1-5.7): 4 weeks
<p><li><b>Vector Calculus</b> (6.1-6.4): 2 weeks
</ul>
<p>
Timing is approximate, and minor changes may be made if necessary. More details will be announced as the course progresses.
<p>
Unfortunately we won't have time to cover the following:
<ul>
<p><li>Parametric and Polar Coordinates (1.1-1.5): Hopefully this is familiar from previous coursework. We might do a bit of review, if necessary.
<p><li>More Vector Calculus (6.5-6.8): This is beautiful material, covered in Math 550.
<p><li>Differential Equations (7.1-7.4): Very important stuff, covered in Math 242 or 520.
</ul>
